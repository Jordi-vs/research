Welke feedback zou je willen geven?
It is a shame that it is not possible to look back to look back (recorded shows and movies). I only watch KPN TV online and have a trouble looking back stored images.
Clearly all channels easy to open
Stopping recording is inexplicable; There is also no possibility to look further
"Very nice everywhere can look, very happy with it"
"Sometimes some unstable, the sound sometimes falls away. I cannot always look from the beginning. However, generally satisfied."
"The BBC First suddenly no longer to be received, get the following error message: Unfortunately we can't find the page you are looking for. This can come through a typo in the address, a page that no longer exists either an outdated bookmark."
Search provides results that you no longer see if you choose View All. I don't think that's correct. The way to add a channel to your favorites is way too tight. Why not add possibility to add after a search.
Almost no reception on KPN TV
"a welcome contribution to direct, undevlared news provision"
"Gives many error messages that look like program asleep. Programs often do not run through each other. The new layout is very irritating and slow, also that larger courses when you get up with your mouse work very annoying. Old layout was much better, finished and was much faster. Also try to penetrate that onmogelije program / zap list as little as possible, because it does not work properly."
Uncluttered. Ideal for looking abroad.
often bad connection
Film starts again and again
"Please make the ability to determine the channel sequence yourself. instead of 1,2,3,4 to ESPN, VIAPLAY, RTL7"
"I have a lot of problems that this program does not work on my computer, one program does it and the other not! Very annoying!"
bad. Too many options. Weird signs at the bottom. The old one was better. Simmerer is often better!
KPN ITV runs constantly buffering and / or poorly quality. Lots of innovation
don't work again
Hapert BBC First
first
good but miss German channels so do something about it
I try from afternoon on the online TV but I get a message that there is a mistake on the page ??
I can no longer receive a number of channels. The comment is 'to receive only at home' highly strange because I am at home and before I could receive them.
It has been terrible lately what others have with Viaplay I have stuttering worthless really irritating at KPNITV
"500-10015 
 Unfortunately we can't find the page you are looking for. This can come through a typo in the address, a page that no longer exists either an outdated bookmark."
"Why doesn't Watch TV online no longer work on the laptop? 
 Always get a message when I click on a transmitter that the page no longer exists. Irritating."
Fine but now go to KPN
"Great website, I use it a lot, even now that I am temporarily not a fixed living space I can continue to watch and record."
"Why can't I use KPN ITV on the laptop of the case, while a colleague can do this and he has Ziggo. I also had Ziggo and I could also do it with my business laptop."
Image remains black in Safari Mac.
"It works almost completely as you would expect. For example, it is a shame that your programs that you have recorded with the TV are always looking back on your PC."
nice to watch
"It is worthless due to poor internet connection. 
 Is constantly falling away"
Great and current
I would like to be able to look as a favorite programs so that I can easily find it.
Everything ok but I want to cancel video country. I can't find how. Your reaction please
"What is this nonsense, last night I could not change Jurassic Park, I want to look further where I stayed, I can't (not be able to impress, I have to see again for 1 hour 45 minutes that I have seen .... real worthless, have you ever tested this yourself ??????"
"Looking back Very deviates from the cupboards, while I am on my own internet signal. I think that's annoying."
"The website has improved enormously over the years. I am very satisfied. Stable, fairly fast, user -friendly."
Lately a lot of hitch and stuck with stream
very well
Nothing change
"Just like at XS4ALL earlier, TV works very nice in this way."
Complaint: 84 programs are included and there are only 29 on the website! I have been working in IT since obtaining my engineering title and it seems easy to solve me
very bad. stops after about 20 seconds. Also after the laptop restarts the router etc. No improvement. XS $ ALL was 100x better! What a decline in quality! Shame!
"No remote control, easy to only occasionally watch a television program (in between)."
Easy and good
Where is NPO 2 extra?
A option via KPN ITV?
I can't log in with KPN ID
"F1 via channel 225 (Viaplay-Saturday and Sunday) cannot look back, in addition the FP 1 and 2 on Friday is not live via channel 225. Via the ViaPlay App (Internet) NB not provided with comment ... Scandal and worthless. .."
good site
Can I be afraid soon the XS4ALL technique back soon? Then at least I can watch TV on my laptop. What a mess I get for the same money as XS4all. Just as expensive not half as good. I'm going to see what Ziggo can offer me!
Why are the German-speaking channels not properly visible and why can't you watch it
I had ordered viaplay and it still doesn't work ?????
"It's really slow when resizing a window on desktop
It would be nice if my favorites synced across different apps"
I am logged in again and now get the message that I would not have the recording package !!! I have had this package for years. How is this possible?
On the app it is difficult to look back from the start or start at the start. The site is very clear and nice. Please use it and daily
Very unfortunate that of the good channel we cannot look back or record!
nicely well-arranged
Special that the KPN environment and application less performed than the current XS4ALL WebTV environment.
All recorded channels can watch
gets better and better. Again suffer from hitches in the image
"Why don't you have Spanish channels in the package, such as Canal24 or TVE1 and TVE2? My mobile is 0651077056"
"It is worthless that the programming is incorrect with reality. 
 Not for the 1st time we can't watch live golf, despite your programming."
Supporting subtitles for hard-hearing would be very pleasant.
"Why can't I view certain recorded programs via my MacBook? They must then be viewed via the TV receiver, while that is possible for other programs. Very weird. I just logged in."
German channels please
I would also like to be able to play foreign recordings
Super beautiful
"I could no longer log in to Online Television yesterday. You indicate that this is at the browser's institutions. But I have changed nothing at all to the settings ... and couple, something has changed, what should you do to indicate the right settings ??? I can't find that. I tried to reach a solution via the chat, but the digital chat indicated that if the password was reset, the problem was solved. I thought that was a strange option (if the password reset?), But good ... this done. The result: I could still not log in to KPN online TV."
Beautiful
"Broadly lines satisfied. Disadvantage is that I have a paid subscription and then certain programs or recordings cannot view via ITV, only via my regular TV. I don't understand why and don't find it tidy that I don't have the same access through here as via my TV."
German canals so if so it is 100%
Scroll back to an overview I think more than now
"I cannot look back at BBC First via ITV app at home, while this should be possible according to the channel overview."
Today the internet site works very badly. I cannot watch programs and have to log in again and again.
"Min 10: Super bad (Sorry to choose 1 star, otherwise you can't send .. it's no service, but watch a derivative of TV."
I still miss the opportunity to get a quick overview of a specific program so that I can see when it was on TV and has been.
I think the fantastie I'm glad this is on my laptop
Easy to look at your work and look back for a good time.
Before
"Too bad that many stored programs cannot be seen on ITV. While they are on the server. 
 Furthermore, very clear image."
it looks good
For this site I would like an app on my desktop of my laptop.
no
"Make sure your app works better for PC. Often problems with the Play Button that does not work, have to load the page and the like ..."
Work well only look back is annoying because you can't click through the advertising
"TOWER to follow in the living room, it is bad at the upper floor and falter the broadcast"
"Excellent, good reception, beautiful image, we have a lot of a small one and look at it with great pleasure"
keep it up
"KPN makes a mess of it in the last week,"
worthless
top
watch TV does not work in Chrome
Awesome! It is a shame that not all channels are available. But works iDEAL.
"Looking back is fine, only fast rinsing is not possible. Makes my frustrated. Can't see the last piece of movie that I missed the night before. Can choose choose, I have to pay again, already have a plus package ........ where does it stop. The video package at Plus is of very low quality, many old films and the films that are 'recently' added, they often come from the existing list. In the paid film providers you are relatively cheaper, with a larger (qualitative) better offer. It is that I have a complete package run at KPN (TV, internet, telephone and various mobile numbers) and transfer to too much effort. But I think more and more to do so. There will be a new glass fiber provider."
Why you can't watch recordings from a number of channels via the laptop because I don't have TV at the moment but look at home
"Since a few weeks I have had a faltering picture and sound from about 1900 hours. Resolution from 750p and higher. No problem during the day. Speed test always gives around 100 Mbit download and 50 upload. That is also fine. Tonight 30/3/2022 it was better. No idea if something is done technically, but I hope that the hacking now stays away in the evenings."
Would like German channels the bee that would be nice
"I am more like abroad, I can also watch my favorites channels"
Is sufficient information and accessible. Sometimes it is a shame that the original publisher releases somewhat cryptic and limited information. This is not clarifiable on this page
Awesome. I enjoy using it every day.
"I would like to see the logo, in the guide to the left a little clearer for example on a white background."
Good that I got a pop-up with request to give opinion because I long that I have a long time that I / we do not get all recorded programs on the website. Already stood on my 'to do'-list.
It really starts to be very annoying that when looking back by a program it is becoming random review
"Why is it not possible to look back on programs via PC? In my eyes it is very illogical that I can plan programs for recording through the website, check if they are included, but cannot look. Then prefer the entire option there."
"Very bad, the search function is not working properly. 
 If I want to look back a program, the program stops random and starts again, very annoying. Some programs look at back and do it anymore. The return period has also become shorter, so you can no longer look back later."
I am satisfied with this online TV page. What disturbs me compared to the KPN guide from the decoder is that you cannot see on the online TV site to which series it goes contrary to the DECODER guide where you can. Can you change that? Would be a valuable addition.
Often does not work well. Returns often not possible. Don't quit. To cattle; Hikes to come into a program.
"Just purchased viaplay. But the race has already been missed because I can't do this through my KPN menu on TV. Thank you for this! If it doesn't do it within half an hour, I am going to orient it from the week to which party I'm going to switch."
If I miss a broadcast I can view it the next day
I think it works great!
"Totally cavish. At Ziggo I was able to flush Comedy Central, with it is not possible."
Everything is susceptible to improvements
TOP SITE
"I am logged in and still cannot look at Viaplay, what a hassle that you have to pay extra for. pfff"
"I get this error message every time I sit at home in NL and have my location on: ""Unfortunately, it is not possible to view videos outside the EU. (500-REF-401) '"
awesome
"The pause button right in the center of the screen remains in the picture 
 You cannot set in the ZAP bar that you only want to zap through your favorite channels 
 German TV channels and Arte cannot be received"
Very pleasant to use
"Nowadays just works well and smoothy kpn .. well done! Occasionally, the subtitles are not synced to look back, but all in all you have one of the better online interactive TV platforms with ITV. Joyful customer here :)"
Why present German channels if they cannot be seen on the page?
first
It is very sad that you cannot watch a Dutch sports program outside of Europe
"Look everywhere, delicious"
In itself good but often small disconnects (that makes you very bland) I am also worse that your German channels often cannot watch or record.
"I'm a fan of BBC First and look at it with great pleasure. 
 Too bad I can't look back programs and when it is included it can only play on the normal TV. I look VNL via the computer."
"A large number; Broadcasts cannot be looked back. 
 Flikken Maastricht is broken down every time for the end when looking back"
Nice right in front of his turnip
"Worthless, because German channels are not available and they do not disappear from now and later, although you indicate that in filters, you will not get any further because you cannot scroll to the left or right now. So you first have to choose a transmitter above 49 to guide and then you can use it again and later. Really XS4ALL, BIG WORDS AND WORK HO."
Can anything look like in Germany only Error 3016
"Well-arranged, works well"
Supah Tof
top just
Not all channels are active on my on-line account
"The program what I click is not what I get to see. 
 So this site is useless."
well-arranged and works well.
first
To serve properly
He's not doing it ..
And again a good number of channels that don't do it! For example Stingray Classica. But others don't do others. I look through a web browser.
Cannot look like programs from RTL4. This has been since yesterday. Very annoying.
bad
Too bad the TV does not start but looks good
Try to see saved movies for some time! Does not appear to be possible: the cursor keeps turning
"L.S. 

 There is currently almost impossible to look at both the app and on the internet, the app runs constantly and must be reset every minute. On the internet there is almost no flaw, this video is not available is actually the most I see when I try to watch TV. 
 It is also not lately, this is a longer running problem where, in my opinion, little attention is paid to. 
 Unfortunately, football is watching, at least not without 7x per half reset from the page or app, with the children no longer possible via the app or another medium."
"Looking back is not possible, just switched to KPN and then Hapert De Lijn (!!! with 1 GB fiber optic !!); That used to be better with Ziggo"
Half of the time it doesn't work properly!
"What a great shit KPN will not get a connection via the internet with ESPN. 
 Do something about KPN ....... 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
"Only NL 1, 2, and 3 are currently working. The other channels do not. Malfunction..?"
good  
Do not charge
Too few films and series can only be looked back on the Teve look back on everything
I am in France with the laptop and a VPN but ho
Worthless you can't view everything you have recorded?!
I'm glad I can see a large number of channels on my computer. What is disappointing me is that I cannot see Belgian or German channels on the computer. National Geographic is not broadcast. Do an Indian? channel. What reasons are the basis of this? Is it perhaps possible to coordinate this offer individually so that I get channels that do have my interest and other people can choose the channels who find them important or interesting again? If they (the non -follow channels) are not broadcast then why they are in the guide. Seems to make someone happy with a dead fish. Sincerely. S.V.D.W.
How do I view Viaplay Xtra on a Chromebook?
"Why is viaplay only to receive on the TV via the receiver. 
 Why not via the app on the computer, tablet or telephone?"
No casting
"To advance, flushing can make it possible for all channels, if necessary then advertising do not make skipping, but can, for example, jump halfway if you may have already looked elsewhere"
Bad regulated that you have to take another Xtra steps for Viaplay at home. I was not clear to me. Now I don't have anything on vacation.
"This really is not to film ... can't log in, can't look training and then you want to watch qualification.. Now forget it !!! And there I pay 14 euros in the month ???? I'm going to cancel and find another road to look! Bah!"
The extra beam at the bottom is fine but a shame that you cannot see which transmitter on state. I think you'll see it better with a brighter border
Why can't you view viale within the EU. Regulations Ziijn still within the EU. You make customers unable to look at Formula 1 on vacation abroad.
In KPN TV from Spain through the WiFi of a good hotel. I use the laptop but always get the message that an unexpected error has occurred when I want to watch the journal. Why not mention what is wrong and what I have to do to look back with the journal.
Fun. Can only watch the Netherlands 1 2 and 3 on Google Chrome. With the rest the site keeps loading.
"A mechanic has already visited 3 times and every time I have the same problem, no TV and internet."
Worthless no internet
"I would like the HBomax app to the KPN TV receiver (such as Netflix and Primevideo). 
 You are the largest provider in the Netherlands and that 
 Must be able to get in terms of service to customers because that app is already there. Can't it be Z.S.M. s.p.?"
"Works very well very satisfied. What I might be a shame that the subtitles of O.A. SBS 6 don't work with back. For this I had Ziggo and it has the same problem. Perhaps this is not yours. Perhaps an app under Windows ITV? Subjects the KPN cabinet for TV, automatic subtitles would be fine. I just switched because of the price but am pleasantly surprised how good everything works."
Effects error-free and easily with the application of stored links to see programs with a click. Would be useful to make it possible in the site. Now I do that via Word. Or is it already there? I just switched from Ziggo to KPN 14 days ago.
Great so I can also watch my programs as a truck driver
I think it's good better overview
"The site has improved a lot and can be looked at all Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, iMac and MacBook)."
"Works particularly well, just a pity that the German channels are not in it, would be a nice addition."
Why can't I look back on my laptop on my laptop and on my TV?
"Hi, since VI today has a new name, namely today Inside (SBS6 half past ten), it can no longer be included. Not on TV, not through the app and not via tv.kpn.com. He gives an error message. Can something be done here?"
Too bad you cannot watch movies on iPad or via 4G.
"I don't know yet, I can't find Viaply"
Site runs way too often !!
"I found the old website more user-friendly, especially the transition from a viewed program (from 'now on TV') back to 'on TV': formerly 1 'click', now 2"
Clumsy + No reference with the TV receiver. And your choices don't work about all your devices
"I now get suddenly on my interactive TV on the PC: not to look outside the EU (500 REF-401) 
 Just sit at home behind the PC to watch TV, have never had this. 
 Like an explanation and solution."
🔥🔥🔥🔥 Call the fire brigade
Viaplay is unknown
Nice quiet website!
I have to switch from the XS4ALL app to KPN. But logging in with the XS4ALL login details can not be done at all.
"He is quick and clear and nice to sit at it without hitches 

 Also nice with a good TV guide and also which channels in your package are toppie thus go through"
Stays very often and sometimes get a black screen and lasts a long time before it has been loaded
bad
Is there a shortcut for Hbomax at the apps? It seems very necessary. Have another older TV and can only look through the laptop and an HMDI
"Bad and unclear The old website was better and had an easier interface for the end user. For nerds such as your developers and programmers, it looks licked but for the end user who usually has a somewhat simpler thought it has not become more convenient to it"
No one channel does it :(
I cannot filter on: F1
You can't even see your recordings on your PC while you have paid for your recordings also through the app this does not consider stepping up to the providor with whom that can feel scammed
Very poor range
Well-arranged but perhaps an option to stream to another screen or confirms
Continuous fault at Online TV with code 3016 !!!!!!
.
Extremely disappointing app
Why can't I see BBC1 and BBC2 on my laptop?
I cannot receive Viaplay.
Since the last changes more often the report 'There is an unexpected malfunction'
"Top, only 'hiking' the internet connection occasionally."
I can look interactively on Z i G Go more and on better quality than on my own K P N How is this possible ???
"I would like to save immediately from one channel to the other, just like at the TV. 
 Now you have to go back to the TV guide and then still click 2x before you can watch."
"With a new option for guide I can no longer watch full screen, I think it's a drifting narrow"
Why do I get home on my imac at Canvas the mention that I can only watch this channel at home?
I keep bothering out news channels
gets better and better. Very easy to use.
'Leviathan' is not from director John Cameron Mitchell
does not work
"Inzich works nicely, sometimes annoying that you cannot rinse ahead. If, for example, you have already seen half on TV. And later the other half wants to look, you have to wait for the middle."
"Works fast, pleasant, is well -arranged. compliments!"
3016 fall
"A few seconds after starting a program or zapping to a transmitter, I always get an error message that 'something has been missed', try again and error code 3016."
"If I turn on full screen, the forward/reverse rinse (30sec) constantly remains in the picture even if I go out of the screen with the cursor. Please restore again. Furthermore, it is very annoying that the possibility of quickly zapping remains visible at the bottom of the screen. likes to hide is very disturbing while watching"
works well
lately steeping stare
The app is well-arranged and works without problems. Two minus points that I can name for now is that I think it is a shame that there is no 10 second flush button in addition to the 30 seconds and that most programs and films that I have recorded cannot look back through the app. I am very curious about the reason for this.
"When watching TV on the computer, there is always message: there has been an unexpected error. Try it later (3016). Do you have a solution for this"
Top!! Keep it up!!
Am satisfied!
I can't find the TV at home via play at other places how can I solve that ??
"The page has become a very more user-friendly, clearer and gives enough info."
Too bad the recordings of BBC First are not watching via the laptop
"I find it shameful and annoying that KPN does not have decent subtitles as one of the largest providers in the online TV app for Dutch programs. It is 2022 people, it is not at the technology so is this just discrimination to people with disabilities?"
sometimes stuck
Works good and simple
I can't find through Play
"Reception is worthless and very poor, every time an interruption in the film that you have to start every time. Even if you rent a paid film. Improve A.U.B. The reception of ITV, the poor reception is very irritating, and does not motivate to look. And that for my expensive subscription every month."
"Am very satisfied except with CNN today because it has a lot of malfuner so that you can follow it very bad, other channels do well"
does not work
"Today's problems, it went well the first few hours but from 10:12 am I continuously continuously the unexpected error 3016 and stops it again. Both at a program from last night I wanted to look back and live TV. Everything on my laptop that nothing has changed (already cookies etc. Removed after reading advice on the forum). Are you working on work? Now with the fiber optic cable this couldn't do anymore?"
When do I just receive Viaplay on Smart TV (225)?
"Does you promise, you promised to watch out of Europe in Asia Kpnitv and Viaplay, Noppes have activated Viaplay and instructed ,,,,,,,,,,, Unable not possible outside Europe, well. Thank you very much"
"Great site, looks tight. 
 The connection is very poor, often stuck. 
 While my WiFi connection is good. For my work I often have to turn night shifts, so I use the online TV service. Since I sit at KPN, this often gives hassle. Never had no problems with Ziggo"
just good
nice and clear
I am in Spain and get a lot of code 3016 on a laptop that is not enough or
"Fault, again"
Great that you can look back later your series (s)
I don't get a series and movies
"Currently many hitches and malfunctions, many error message 3016. 
 Don't know if this comes through the changes that you are doing but I don't make a happy one for a few days."
"Stops on the PC for a long time, it is nice when you can switch with the arrow keys certainly at the foot balls."
no image
"If you float over an item, possibly more program info would be useful (such as the TV version after clicking on an item)"
Smooth running site Everything easy to find
I would like German and Belgian channels
Great site with goods. Faster to go to another channel would be very welcome.
Hiccups regularly
Nice
No reception yesterday KPN TV online ???? Saved programs can also not be looked back
good improvement
I can still find anywhere in the channel list via play
"Why can't I look back through online TV broadcasts that are via a TV with decoder (or how hot) are looking back? BV BBC First. I can't look back on it, but my neighbors can do that via their TV. We both have a plus ... What about that?"
"Absurd How often continues to load a program, falter or forcing to reload the page. It is 2022 Come On"
"The black fade when pause is awkward occasionally. Do you look who is the mole? Pause you to see it better what the direction in a very short shot comes by. When pause, his fade is over which the image becomes darker. Furthermore, KPN TV works well via the browser"
always useful
Super site very handy and easy
"can't be better, just perfect"
Still no Viaplay
Constant channels that spontaneously have the children's lock on!
Leave images grouped together
Why do I get an error message
"Practical page. Generally works functionally well. Sometimes I find it switching between channels, also looking while watching and going back to the previously selected channel."
The image quality is constantly changing from sharp to Heek vague. and the porgammas get stuck every few seconds
I have never had such a bad service. I have a big problem and there are still 37 waiting for me and that after I had to answer 10 questions first
Clear and organized. Unfortunately occasionally a problem with your own recordings if they remain on Pause.
Excellent only should be nice when looking by repetitions of series such as Gold Rush would be nice when I could see where I have stayed and could also look a few episodes in succession
"Why do I get this announcement and I am no longer able to use KPN ITV: 
 An unexpected error has occurred. Please try again later. (3016)"
KPN ITV never works on the computer always get an error message
Good info and a well-arranged site fast connection and you know which channels you are on canceled
Fine! Very user-friendly. There is only one thing that could improve and that is the subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing. E.E.A apron apron.
"Lays buffering again for the umpteenth time, just a dredger from an app, from the beginning and never what to improve it. Ziggo, Netfix, video country all no problem."
"There are too often faults, which controls streaming. Unfortunately"
Clear program guide. Look from start function is very nice. And excellent image quality.
Budget is worthless.
Have got
Excellent app and website
"Great, you don't have to turn on the TV (puts others in the room bv.) And see everything on your laptop."
The Stop Suddenly
Only no Beel
Sometimes finding a channel / program is difficult
Previous version was easier / clearer
first !
usually works well
"good,"
Difficult to switch from channels
"Structure is different from TV receiver, there is less information to see. If you go with the mouse over a (saved) broadcast, the picture becomes larger and partly about the already limited info from other broadcasts. If you return from a series of serial recordings, you will not be back in the total overview, but in the limited starting overview. Then you must first click again to get in the total overview and search where you left. It may be a little less black, sometimes things are not to distinguish from each other because everything is black. etc. etc."
The programs keep 'crocheting' for a long time and if you want to flush in recorded programs you have to wait a long time and he regularly returns to the starting point on its own. Programs of the BBC are completely a drama to watch.
Always work!
"It works, but the program guide is slow and little clear. Furthermore, the operation is not very consistent between computer app, tablet app and TV receiver software. That is much better."
Everything OK
Don't leave so fast
it knights how to look like this is looking back and he has just started the third time again
I like it
"Am very voted about receiving the broadcasts, although strangers occur."
"Too complicated, often not working, no overview. Poor supply of plus package. Films is really laughing bad."
"The back button does not go back to where you come from, you have to click 2 times again button"
Zoom in to the channel where you hang up with the mouse are annoying and not desired and have no added value to choice policy
"very well filmed, good inzicht into what really happens"
Recorded a program today. Unfortunately I am thrown out halfway and then I can no longer rinse.
The TV guide does not charge programs from 5 p.m. So for this time I see which programs come on TV but from this time the guide will turn black and I no longer see programs. How can I solve this?
Load page lasts long and often no image or sound! I use glazfiber internet here
Does not work at all when I am in Germany
The new layout/layout feels less beautiful and streamlined than the previous one. It is no longer possible to go to 'Start''nu on TV' etc while watching a program. This makes use online a lot less pleasant
Tonight is very bad. Buffering and bad image
Too bad some programs are only on television and not to look back on web.
Clear and fast
"I like to watch the laptop to record programs. Unfortunately I cannot watch the programs from Dutch channels, such as BBC First and the Belgian channels; Although these are part of my package. I think it is very unfortunate that this latter category can only be viewed through the receiver and not via the laptop. KPN cannot change in this and if not, why not?"
Don't turn to the K KPN junk
Currently always falls out !!
"Unfortunately, not all series can be viewed on the laptop. Then only looks at the TV. I experience as frustrating."
"I get the trailer cast but not the film, WT F?"
At Ziggogo you get a moving live image from each transmitter but at KPNITV a fixed picture. Can something be done about this?
"If it can be another format for the guide, per channel and time"
You have to perform an extra action. is something clumsy.
"Very easy to find everything. And super user-friendly. Sometimes in the beginning it takes some getting used to it, but you quickly know you to leave!"
I would like a larger screen.
Slow switch between channels
first
good  
KPN became worthless provider caps with that mess
keep it up.
Awesome!!
The subtitles cannot be turned off - somewhat annoying
"Film 'No time to which' rented, every 5 minutes the movie starts again on new. Bad!!"
"Fairs often with live stream, it rinses 20 x back and it starts again, while eg NPO plus it just does."
"Ridiculous that your channels such as BBC, BBC2 BBC World News cannot view online, but only at home. What do you need here. Moreover, France2 is also not available if I am looking for this."
can not look out of episodes
Very handy to also be able to watch TV occasionally without a TV.
"I can't look back with the lounge TV channel via WebTV, but on the TV."
Return function on Eurosport disastrous. Do not start
Nice I can't watch TV but record ??????
"Great, but always know better"
"On this page are recommended for you all porn movies. How is that possible while I don't look at this? Moreover, I checked to hide the erotic channels. I don't want to see this kind of images."
"New customers watch free F1, checking existing customers."
Works good and is nice in use
Sometimes the timeline crashes and then you can no longer go back or back
"I can only watch the Netherlands 1, 2 and 3, with all other channels the image continues to load but nothing happens."
I can't stream with Chromecast
"Programs start looking at or watch from the beginning at the beginning like VI today. This is quite annoying, you fall in the middle of a conversation and misses information. 
 Hopefully you will do something about it."
"- Too many intermediate pages when starting a program 
 - would like to change the color pattern 
 - Too many disturbances"
Further watching does not always work. Series / movies can be found back can be clearer. Option to watch / series to look for several people and 'finish'
It is very unfortunate that you can only look at a number of channels at home for the rest it works fine
"Web TV is really terrible. Always problems, or program not included or bad image or runs all the time. And now a new problem. Recorded program that I want to look starts again and again."
"Website functions well, well -arranged and I miss nothing"
Prima
I'm happy with it but I usually just look at the journal 'inherends
Excellent only annoying how often I have to click before the broadcast of your choice starts. There can be a click away
"Nice website, with a difference of taste what you want to look at home, this is a very good solution."
"Often faltering image. For comparison, Netflix never gives a faltering picture."
Good site
The connection to the site is broken every 5 minutes. This is the only website with which I have this problem.
is easy to watch here on your laptop if you don't do normal television
I use the site much when I travel and in most countries she works great. Total lack of spam is a relief. That saying said a monthly update would be possible with guide and movie offers etc.
first
Clear and easy to find and use
"Hello, this is the second time I message you about this. But as a result of my previous message I have heard nothing of you.
XS4ALL WebTV offers the possibility to record programs from the BBC. However, when I want to watch them, the sound does not run synchronously with the image, and much disturbed, after a minute or 20 shooting back to the beginning and I can't see the rest of the program anymore.
I hope you understand that this is super irritating: I don't take the programs for nothing. In this concrete case it is about Mary Beards Forbidden Art Season 1 episode 2 (10 Februrari 22:00). I would like to see it, complete, and preferably the image and sound synchronously and I would appreciate it that you make this program nicely available.
Otherwise, not to mark BBC as' scheduling 'admission' because that promise can apparently systematically systematically. And as a customer I is misled because incorrect expectations are awakened.
I would like to hear from you.
Yours sincerely
Petra"
"The functionality of the previous version needed fewer clicks, which was more pleasant."
Great and well-arranged
I switched from Ziggo to KPN more than a month ago. What strikes me is that the Ziggo Go app is much more user -friendly on a number of points. Programs can be looked back immediately (and not only after 20 minutes) Picture in Picture during scrolling and a much clearer TV guide. Are just a few things. When will you come up with an upgrade?
"Looking back program takes too long before it is available. Then you can watch the current time slot from the start, but not. So you can't look at sports competition from the start because it is in the time slot. And that is not yet available to look back."
"Through my laptop I can't view anything with my account, which browser I also try. Every time, there is an unexpected error occurred every time. Please try again later. (1001) '. You can always work via the app on my phone. Why can't it work?"
Even with a bad WiFi I can still watch TV in Luxembourg :)
"Nice commentary, good image"
"Something has changed, D menu bar at the top is away when I see a program. Now I always have to go back through a arrow, that is awkward"
Just getting used to in the beginning but can now handle it well.
"Dear KPN I TV, I'm worse 'death' to your broadcasts. The films are always interrupted, and you cannot restore it yourself!. What is going on with it, on the internet, even people complain about it. This generates a variety of irritation !!. KPN subscriptions are already expensive, and then this. Restore the kpnitv a.u.b. It is already at all my pleasure, do I pay all for that? Word time for compensation"
Easy and simple
Good overview nice and fast and many channels
Not everything works optimally
". A lot of malfunction (especially with recorded programs, all at the recording of the BBC) 
 . Combut the programs unexpected 
 † KPN lets all his ears depend on the wishes of the commercial channels (with that advertising hassle and cannot rewind). Since KPN is far too big for that?"
Good clear page with a fat but! Too often faltering images.
Awesome
"I'm used to it so so it's okay. 
 First it was looking for me and thought again changes."
"Very beautiful, works great; And quickly I miss when you look at a program an easy way to get information about the program (the yellow button on the TV remote control). But maybe it is already there and I haven't found it yet ...."
"Sometimes the reaction is slow from the menus, and loading a given moment in a program lasts long, while that part seems to be in memory."
"Recorded program starts again after a minute, sometimes a little longer."
"Many programs cannot be looked back immediately. Bee. Nieuwsuur, has already been over for an hour, but not yet to look back. That was possible at Ziggo and Canal Digital."
Many malfunctions during the playback of all recorded TV programs.
Very nice and nice to watch
Works super good
"Hello KPN ITV, I wondered if it might be possible and even though it might not be possible .. but it is possible that if I enter a series of a series in the search bar that I therefore only spread that season. receive. Now it is so, in this case at 'Air Crash Investigation' that I don't care if I type Air Crash Investigation S10 or Season 10, if that is still possible to look back. 
 Now I happened to happen that it is at 'Air Crash Investigation' that, for example, there is a season 10 in title but actually belongs to season 11. I just wanted to let you know in case this can be changed / improved. 

 Kind regards, 

 Marijn Ganzevles"
"The app is completely jerk! I have already reported a few times, nothing improves! 
 Is continuously fixed, the connection loses despite the fact that WiFi signal is good. 
 Halfway through program I suddenly shoot the beginning"
KPN is cunt
no one
"Playback of recording on PC often does not run synchronously or runs and starts from start, in particular BBC2. Impossible to watch. The vertical navigation bar is on some screens in frame, on others you have to use the browser bar."
nice and convenient in Oostrijk where we are now
Sometimes no sharp image
"Warefold service that I want to see a program back on the TV on the TV, but not via the laptop. It should still be possible that KPN sees that I am a customer when I am using a userid login. I think KPN should come soon with something, so that I can also see things on a laptop, which I can do through the cupboard."
Sometimes the connection is huge; And that is not the WiFi.
Two buttons miss a left and a right to go to the other channels. The function simply works. In the TV guide function it is possible and there are visual buttons. I think they were gone after an update.
The WiFi connection is constantly broken. Especially now with skating via the laptop watching during my work. Very annoying.
"often unclear 
 Hard navigation"
clear and clear layout. It would be useful if stated which channels I cannot view through this site
"Sometimes many hitches, but if it works well; good to fine"
Quality has been bizarrs bad since a few days. Often malfunction. Often still image and loss of internet
Mass old screen where you immediately got the menu
"ESPN Send far too few matches. 
 And during switching programs far too few images of competitions that are not broadcast in its entirety. And too many images of competitions that are already broadcast in its entirety to the various ESPN channels."
"Functions perfectly! I watch TV for my work and so I can switch very well, record things, look back, etc. makes my life a lot easier. Very happy with it. †"
"A few improvements would be handy such as: 
 & GT; Subtitles to be set by recordings of non-Dutch channels such as BBC (reported earlier) 
 & GT; Making ahead of watching in the TV guide, so that you don't have to go to the tap above it 
 & GT; When you are logged out, and log in again, you don't have to give your favorites again and again"
I like me fine
KPN makes this XS4ALL called! Keep the tradition in honor! XS4ALL !!!! XS4ALL !!!!
"The web environment for online TV from KPN has recently been updated. If you now open recordings via 'saved', then go to a recorded series and this opens, there is no longer any possibility to scroll to the right (with an arrow). Even with the trackpad you cannot 'swipe' to the right to view the rest of the recordings of the relevant series. 
 Tested on Safari and MS Edge on MacOS 12"
Every Sunday evening the streaming service fails. worthless. do something about it.
"I would like to see more films by the Netherlands Bottom of Bert Haamstra and Progamma, S from the 1960s and Seventy"
works top
"KPN ITV no longer works in Safari 15.4 in Os Monterey 12.3 Bèta (21e5196i) app does start on but with channel choice blocked the channel immediately and it comes back in the previous screen. In Google Chrome in the same environment, however, it works"
"Dramatically bad ITV app, I get a black image and sound. As I see in 1000 topic starter on the forum, I am not the only one. Is there a solution once? Since I have never had a problem with Telfort! Otherwise I have to switch to another provider!"
"When looking back, programs are demolished earlier than before."
"Previously you could see a program directly when it was recorded, that is no longer possible online."
Is perfect
Recently the screen settings are no longer correct! I get a considerably reduced image where the text is virtually not readable. Always enlarge and reduce screen. That just doesn't work. Screen settings are also nowhere to be found to set it differently
I would like to see through to the next channel
functions well
It is fine. But where is NPO 2 extra?
Does what to do
a little slow. But okay
Better than Ziggo Go
"Offer and functionalities are great. Response is often a bit slow and the platform is relatively often suffered from some annoying bugs, so there is no optimum user experience."
"There is very much repeated, unfortunately."
unstable
This is really nice and nice to have. KPN a big 10.
Why has extra clicks introduced? Can no longer go directly to main menu. First have to return via arrow on the left on the screen. Every time Iter knows that extra actions are not smart.
Very good but I miss more choices.
I want to look back with subtitles of a Jeugdjournaal. Not subtitles. I am deaf.
The site works well
Works great but when I select on a program I find it annoying / awkward to click on 'watch' now '.
first
Recommendations are fine
"I am very happy with it, due to chronic illness, I am dependent on this website, I want to see my fav. programs at times that I can do it !!!"
"I am very happy with it, use it every night"
"The page is pretty good, but if you cast to the TV it remains and buffer, while Netflix and prime just stream smoothly."
"I only miss the rule at the top with start, now on TV etc. Furthermore everything is fine."
good but he fails a lot on the laptop
"I cannot completely change the saved programs through my computer the last days. Halfway it stops and I get a notification: ""We have saved where you left."" After which I can no longer look further. 
 The program does not even start at some. And then it only concerns programs from Ned1.2 and 3."
"From minute 49 to the end of the film, the lyrics that are spoken are suddenly gone and you only hear background sounds. 

 Very annoying if you are just in the movie and have paid 3.99 for it."
bad
"Good look options. 
 I look every day, perfect nothing to change."
Super ... I couldn't live anymore
There is something wrong too often
Very often error messages as an unexpected error occurred. Please try again later. (6002)
It is difficult that you cannot view everything you have recorded with your TV on ITV.
"3-4, very frequent break figurines"
"Site works fairly smoothly and user interface okay, it is very unfortunate that so many channels cannot be seen online, not to watch and look back but not. Clear disadvantage compared to Ziggo."
Connection falls out regularly!
"Totally top sure the new setting, larger image etc."
Do not change. All information is fully and concisely present.
"Totally perfect, .."
Great online TV !! Nice and easy!
I do miss the German channels
Very user-friendly!
"After a longer pause, connection no longer comes about and you have to start again. That's annoying."
"Good interface, only super cunt that does not come with sport a pop up that is live before I hear neighbors cheering. Furthermore, top top top"
Connection is always gone
Many failures and almost never loads
"Work great. I would like to be able to set up an alert for upcoming programs in the guide. 
 Or that is automatically switched to the other channel when the program starts."
"It often happens during front and back coils, sometimes loses connection and does not remember where you have remained."
Too bad lounge is not watching the PC.
"Can't ITV via a laptop. 
 Get notification: An unexpected error has occurred"
"Okay, only often bad connection"
It was easier for the update to switch between channels. Dropout from the top screen was very nice.
I cannot find image quality under institutions
"It would be nice if the functionality of the website comes to the KPN TV app. For example, rinsing with the slider. In the app this always goes with steps (I suspect 30 sec). You can never leave the slider a little bit or back. 
 It would be nice if you can choose in the TV guide to let a shot made GlasHD which you can then look back on TV."
Click too much to change channels
"Too much malfunction: I get a green, running 'wheel' too regularly 'and I must first wait 5 seconds and then another 10 or 20 seconds until he picks up the thread again. 
 And the last change is not a success: to zapping I now have to click twice because the topbar has disappeared."
works great and is well-arranged
The page does not charge to look at
He stops very regularly
The menu bar is gone
The search Die is an unutian bar (The Search Function is Sooo Bad)
"I have a black image, a sound. What can I do about it. I did not exhibit the app as a favorite NPO via their website also gives black image."
Runs so occasionally when looking back
"WebTV, program included with the BBC. 2 weeks behind this: sound does not run synchronously with the image. And the recording stays every time. This does not use the recording."
"Very often stuck (via Safari on MacBook) and it takes quite a long time before a program is available to be able to look back, Ziggo is many times faster after a program broadcast has ended."
"I'm updating and try looking through my laptop 
 There seems to be a malfunction because I can look up the press conference in the guide but this does not start playing & gt; 
 I see Rutte appear but that video does not play, this also happens with a number of other channels whose video does not boot & GT; 
 I look more likely to see the news from this location as I ff the news but that worked well before"
"Works reasonable, but I would like to see where I looked at the previous evening!"
Recordings sometimes do not or only half.
Find it bad that I can't look at certain recordings on the laptop. Take a lot on and because I am irregular work it is sometimes nice to look back on bed. And that is not possible with some series or channels. Due to my waiting times in my work sometimes sometimes look back the possibility and that is not possible
Not always stable in connection
clearly in use
Starts almost every time and not where you left watching
Especially recordings of the BBC are always stuck.
Just nice that you can easily arrange and watch recordings.
Constant malfunction and cannot look back any film without stopping halfway.
I do have the recording package but it is indicated that I don't have that.
Super
"Unstable, falter and stuck ... despite a good WiFi connection"
I sometimes lose programs included
"Would be handy if I could also set the reminder in the online TV guide, so that my TV automatically switches to that channel, if the TV is on, of course."
"Works slowly. Sometimes strikes for a long time. Passes badly with falling/busy network (WiFi). Do not remember where it gone with a crash. 
 It can be made so made so that the sound always gets priority above the image."
often insert into a malfunction
reasonably adequate
Goes back
"It is strange that some recordings can only be seen via the TV receiver. It would be useful if there is more interaction between online TV, TV receiver and the ITV app."
"Good day, I can only watch the live broadcasts. 
 I can press the previously broadcast programs. Then playing is prepared, but not played."
Completely fell that you have to start the internet again every day and then to ITV via the KPN website ...
I can't look back on the laptop
"Why does playing things that you have saved work so unbelievably poorly on the laptop? Buffering every 2 seconds, very much. Strangely enough work works better than something that is stored?"
It is sometimes difficult because then you want to look something and you cannot log in to the program in advance
"With the ITV app I cannot watch TV with WiFi on my new (Samsung) TV. If I press the pause button and then want to look further, the broadcast will immediately go back to live. That way I can't go back to the start when something is broadcast live and I will look later. That is possible on the iPhone and iPad with the ITV app. I also can't play BBC First and Canvas if I have recorded broadcasts. NPO channels, the commercial channels and Fox, then again. I have already called customer service, but I did not get a conclusive answer. I would like to get an explanation, because I don't get it."
I can watch TV good
This work does not
"You can please turn on the original sound at ESPN, because the Dutch comments from the gentlemen of ESPN make no sense and remove the whole experience of the channel. So please just back the US commentary."
I think it's a shame that I cannot view my recordings on other device and only on TV and that in the time of tablets and iPads
Nvt
Every 10 minutes that fucks KPN is flying out ...
"get stuck after a break, very irritating"
"Many channels cannot be watched online, black image and only sound,"
"bad connection, always runs"
Perfect
"Recorded programs are often hanging so that I have to start again. During ahead of rinsing, he stays great."
"When I look at scheduled recordings on Saturday, laptophy with Friday. He should come with the day you are"
"Feet Back Interactive ITV Inclanc-for-Traffic 
 Nice, easy and lonely entertainment!"
"That your series Close to see me 1st part. Missed 
 Why can't this ??"
"Program, s play a falter"
Series regularly gets stuck
Find this better than the TV
"I often use it, works comfortably"
13/1 SBS6 Some program only shows no sound
"Find it easy to operate, and well -arranged"
There is an irritating malfunction in the sound. An 'hub' every five seconds. It is not in my system.
"Always when I have recovered programs from the BBC lately and later look back on my laptop, seeing image and sound not synchronous! I have to throw away everything without looking away, David Bowie, West Side Story etc ... Worthless, KPN! I never bothered this with Ziggo."
4 stars because not all transmitters can be seen or be through the normal TV.
I don't like this for the end is abruptly removed.
Very happy with it
"Live broadcasts falter regularly. Image remains standing still while text continues. You can also no further advance programs, it will continue to falter and the circle turns around."
"No German channels on KPN Online TV, not even when you have purchased a subscription to German -speaking channels. Really scandalous"
It is fast and well-arranged
How come I don't get a picture of my iMac when I play a program?
"on my Ipad and Iphone , it is not smooth watching...also from certain channels I  can't watch only on the decoder.  we do paid for On the go....but that is NOT what we get"
Where has Canal 82 NPO2 Extra remained?
"Great site, lots of choice"
"I have received 100 GB of data to watch TV on my laptop, well it's not a meter it is nothing with the connection to my phone, and we have to wait a lot too long for a 48 hour mechanic is a joke, Just look at the competition"
Why can't I see a video country on my laptop and on my TV? I have a subscription?
"I finish it nicely. 
 The speech provision for hard hearing works better as ITV on the Arris TV receiver. With the teletext button and blocker you have to view the other functions on the remote at the same time. The black bars are also disturbing there."
Hapert sometimes
"Very much malfunction on TV in the last 3 weeks 
 image is certainly 5 times a night away"
"Hopeless with 2Mbps to internet speed, every 10 minutes to reset the modem o so-called updates is laughable"
"In the web-based ITV application, the 'Further Look' function has no longer worked properly. I only see there pay movies that I have never watched"
There is an annoying hitch in the sound.
Gift 1 film of your choice does not work
The 'Further look at the list saves everything that has been active. I want to delete this
"Videoland work no longer has been to let him cancel since a few days since you can't look on Videoland.nl because then I have to take a new subscription again 
 greeting mario"
Deep grounds are hanging halfway
I ordered ESPN. On the iPad and laptop it goes well but on the TV it is not visible. What's wrong?
"Handy and nice if you have missed a broadcast of a certain sport, series or film every now and then. 
 But why are the not affiliated members of e.g. Ziggo to be able to watch F1, make a nice package of those sports that are happy to look at, we as an example football on TV is a pollution of our goods but also more of ;-) but certainly a horrible scab Soccer and certain martial arts who even prevent it."
Can not get image overwhaches ...
Recordings are really not to be viewed via the browser. The image always sticks. Network speed up and down from 200mbs or more. Really not to do lately.
Not used friendly and crashed / hardly runs very often.
"We can no longer see NPO2Extra; Was with us at 88; went to 82, but he is not there"
"I have purchased a film via tv.kpn.com, Paw Patrol, but in the app and on the TV I don't like it. 

 I would like to get my money back."
"Why can I leave Dexter: NEW BLOOD Don't look back with everything from the start? Come on, KPN, your selection of films and series is already so skinny and outdated."
Good quality just like on TV itself. TOPPIE !!
I have a code for a free movie. Where can I enter these to redeem it?
"Disappearing NPO 2 extra What is that now? The start of the disposal of the best interesting channels? 
 Add it again,. SVP Install NOP 2 extra"
"Handy in use look a lot back and use it often. 
 There are of course improvement points, for example, there should be links to Nar Netflix, video country, NPO start so that you can watch everything from 1 site. And it would be easy if there is also an app for computers and laptops. 
 look back for quite 10 days and that was very pleasant to look back to look like a long time than 7 days because you often come across a series of show that you like that already turned out to be a week before you could have it then the then Just look back next day but that is no longer possible. Mar is completely satisfied."
good
Nice because you can always see everything again
I can't watch Videoland suddenly while that was always possible and I also just have the Videoland package. On TV it does and not in ITV itself.
Very informative
"I can't watch KPN Online TV on the laptop via the WiFi. It indicates that no videos outside the EU can be watched (50 or 500-Ref-40) I still live in the Netherlands and have a normal KPN connection. How is that possible? I would like to hear from you about this error. 
 With kind regards, R.L. Pinas."
"Unfortunately I cannot watch Netflix on my laptop through the WiFi. He indicates that unfortunately it is not possible to view videos outside the EU (500 ref-40) 
 I'm not on a wifi outside the EU. Just live in the Netherlands. How can this be solved?"
Perfect image on my macbook !!
"Works fine in itself, I just don't understand that very many programs cannot be seen within a week. And I miss a bookmark for TV programs watching (if you have not seen them completely) This is better arranged for the competitor. I hope for an update. Furthermore, so fine and stable."
No subtitles in the film. We cannot understand half but paid. Bad room
"WebTV: With recorded programs, the sound does not run synchronously with the image. Other channels are doing well. Super irritant. Restarting does not help. hope you can solve this soon"
Top your online TV
"L.S. The TV guide often does not match the programming at that time (see CNN). The transitions between two programs often gives a disturbance. When a program look back, the jumps are weird if the relevant program has ended. All this was better for a while ago. VR GR RONALD"
can not connect
"It actually always went flawless, however, the last days I get the message every time that it has occurred (1001) and that I have to try again later. I 
 Unfortunately without the desired result. What's wrong ?????"
Your erotic!
The programs I saved have all disappeared? How is that possible?
"Everything easy to find, so very well-arranged. 
 Thanks!"
"If you choose Films or Series, the error messages gives. 
 Log out does not help 
 Do not close window either 
 Removing cookies either works either."
"Works great, which I am enormously wrong is a kind of bookmark watching TV programs if you have not copied them yet. And a Chome in app is also useful"
"Not all recorded programs can be looked back at KPN via the laptop, something that worked great at Ziggo."
Betting operation
Often very difficult to reach.
Not all channels that you can watch on TV can also be seen online
Why does only NPO 1-2 and 3 work on my Chromebook
""
"On the laptop it gives if you have put a series on a break that he has no connection, then you should find where you left, because he doesn't care where you left. This does happen on television."
"Why not the possibility to look back through the website, which I can get back via modem?"
"I get the last few days the message that the program should not be viewed outside the EU, but I'm just in the Netherlands. How is this possible?"
"The app often does not work,"
Hard to view subscription number. And reset password. Very difficult. †
good  
"awkwardly use, - bookmarks, nobody knows what it is for, once it can't go back, you have to click tig times if you want to remove something and when canceling a series he will continue to record it while he spontaneously removed series himself -not recording more."
Fine layout and working properly.
awesome
"Solid, reliable and user-friendly. KPN worthy."
"worthless, always interrupted films, while I have fiber optics and a KPN subscription"
"Over time, the cache still wants to continue, if I paused for a while, and then I cannot start the episodes (continue to buffer)"
Why can't I see recorded movies / series on my PC?
"The internet is very bad, often everything is falling. several times per evening. And this has been around for months. 
 not necessarily this page ... is about bad internet"
Want to function poorly at Safari.
"If I don't think of you, but on some channels I get the message that I cannot rinse ahead, but it appears after trying a few times, still work (SBS O.A.). Like tonight at House in The Country."
sublime
"I don't go to the Online TV page. I am about placing behind the child lock of the delivery ring of the VPRO over Greyson Perry on December 30. I have now seen one episode, with my children, the rest should also be available but the episode about an artist who is controversial and as a man being dressed as a woman must be behind the child lock. Not really from this time if you ask me. Of course I can choose from it yourself to show this to my children, but my children cannot choose here yourself. It seems like a form of censorship within one program concept to allow one episode and not the other. Maybe I should see it first and then I understand why this choice is made. I'm curious."
I miss the German channels
"Can't watch TV despite all my efforts and telephone contact with KPN. 
 very unfortunate The last telephone response .... We will deposit the money back to your account"
Commercial channels do not work
"A lot of transmitter does not work via the laptop (MacBook). (always worked earlier) 
 Several browsers tried. 
 When printed on the play button, nothing further happens. 
 Watching TV Through the laptop does not work at all now."
I lose my favorite channels every time.
I always use this. Everyday
"Sometimes confusing, would like to see that when I restart (computer turns on) that I am in the same timeline in which I live. And more options to look back"
Super
Serious KPN? At Christmas I can't watch this film as a loyal customer half a day later? What a Christmas letdown.
Can't watch TV online
I actually get scared of your policy
"Ideal, exactly as I want it."
Sound cracks some channels
"Since yesterday I have no sound on my laptops, films and broadcast, on my smartphone 
 24-12-2021"
Does not play exorn code 1001 ??
Super that I can watch my stored films everywhere
"I have recently received error message 3016. 
 What does that mean?"
"Unstable, connection too often falls away. If the program is started again, it does not play from the place where the connection fell away."
Film Gemini Man Friday 17 Dec 2021 Spike sticks to exciting moment and goes no further.
"If I want to watch a program in the evening, the broadcast is constantly faltering. Looking back during the day is fine. Is there a special reason for that? Can I reduce the resolution for looking back, so that the stream might be better?"
"Now again, sometimes you have to click something else I've done after the feedback and then the sound did again"
I can't put it harder or softer
"It functions in itself, sometimes slow. However, what is disturbing that not all recorded programs are canceled"
Top
"If I want to watch a movie, the film must load every 10 seconds. It hardly happens in the last days that a film can be watched at once without such annoying interruptions."
Super good especially if your husband and children want to see something else I can get away with this
does not work
Keep it up
From today I can no longer look at the computer .....
Excellent formerly incident's small hitch
is better than before
That if you take a break with looking back that it cannot be remembered
"I would like to follow programs and can easily look up the last broadcasts through your own page, such as NPO or NLzite. Is this something still coming?"
"It could be less focused on TV, and more on content"
Not being able to go back or flush it makes no sense. Sometimes the video does not survive at other time.
Outcome
"Bad, stops regularly"
"Episodes from The Bold Classics only plays the first +/- 7 mini-people, the image will load and you don't see anything anymore. Unfortunately!"
"- Setting memories (also for series) is not online. 
 - German channels are not available online (NB: directly via the internet, e.g. NDR!) 
 - Not all recordings are available online 
 - The title of a broadcast disappears behind the margin, creating an empty bar (sometimes)."
"That not only work is done the functionality of the app (Anfroid/iOS) but also under Windows. 
 Because certain functions sometimes don't want to work under Windows. 
 That all channels, such as on TV, are available via WiFi of the KPN Router."
great
Comfortable to be interspersed in the evening with work a movie.
It takes quite a long time before you have a program that has already ended
"Yes I don't want to break out of course, but here on Granranaria he often falls out and you no longer come up."
Does not work completely smoothly. Stays often. Occasionally an error message. And a shame that some channels cannot be seen back ..
"Unfortunately, several channels cannot be viewed, but these are shown. When recording, for example, a film, there are also channels where the advertising cannot be skipped and I assume it. Furthermore, it is all I can see for me and am happy with this possibility, unfortunately I still have no connection and therefore designated on this site."
"Very annoying that you cannot look back or rewind many programs (while the same channels can look back and rewind on TV! 
 And it is also annoying that if you put a arrow back (& lt ;-), it doesn't go back to the overview, but that you have to put back arrow again. Very cumbersome and I don't understand where that is good."
I have ziggo sport but can't find the channel
Does an error code 3016 indicate?
The connection is constantly / very often broken to unclear causes. 9 out of 10 times must be logged in again.
bad quality
Ridiculous that it is so unclear which matches you can and cannot look. I have been busy for 2 hours but get totally opposite messages about ESPN and competitions that I cannot watch with that. It is of course a bit of a trick of yours to keep this vague. I will cancel the same subscription on Monday.
I want contact but that is not possible
"Works good, unfortunately occasionally delays on broadcasts or the site does not work at all"
"I find the start -up page annoying: 'When sliding with the mouse, the channels are always increased, which is annoying when searching for a certain channel'! T"
keep it going
watching programs not possible
"Episode has not been broadcast through interactive TV receivers and also not via online TV (single still image to see). 
 (https://tv.kpn.com/play/program/883834743)"
"worthless, wants to look at my championships and none 
 Connection while I am at home and not at the campsite. 
 Thank you KPN. Time to go to another provider."
It is useful to be able to save movies as a favorite to watch later.
"You gave a fifteen minute a failure before the end of this series, so I have to miss the end and I can't see him again. Worthless KPN ITV !!!!!!"
Can't say I'm glad. Picture is often silent.
"Not so pleasant if on December 17 at 10.15 pm the last 5 to 10 minutes loss from the second episode of 'Manhunt' on Canvas by a malfunction on the 3 Belgian channels and you miss the clou of the story !!! 
 Extremely sorry :(."
"Worthless! No WiFi since 15-12 and when the phone is closed on TV, the image is not shown. Only of the 3 first channels."
Crashes!!
Can you tell me when the problems of the different channels have been solved?
"I look back the smartest man, it suddenly stopped with the announcement that I cannot look back on that program. Do I pay too little or do you not find your obligations?"
I only get error messages here 1001
"Does not go smoothly at KPN. Update Box failed. Have it 3, ticks only 1. Consider going to T. Mobile. IntnNet malfunction from 16.12.2021 2054 hours"
"Easy, all clear"
"Mobile streams badly (often sticks, completely with a piece back). Layout ugly and unclear. Show programs for which extra abo needs needless (and annoying)."
Sticking out
"If 'eroticism' is checked, this is also prominent in the picture in the TOIP bar, perhaps a little less visible, also applies to decod cabinet."
"Image quality more blurred. 
 Opsporing Verzocht Never look as possible? 
 So don't watch the journey of your genes (500 ref-408)?"
"I suddenly miss a number of channels that I could see through browser in ITV, O.A. BBC channels. That is no longer possible."
"I find it annoying that with some episodes you cannot rinse ahead if you have pause or recorded them and also that the recorded programs are available as available, but if the storage is too full, it is simply written over it without reporting and because I often watch TV On my computer it is also strange and annoying that you cannot look at some things on ITV online, in my eyes all makes no sense"
Do not start a program very often.
"Pretty annoying and incomprehensible that you have to have viewed a movie within 48 hours. I have paid, then I can still look out at least the movie you would think. If this fails due to circumstances, you can go to rent the film again. I sat at 1.43m from ex machina (fantastic movie). First and last time Pathé. A shame and therefore a missed opportunity for you."
"The app is not stable. Missed a piece or end of a film several times, because online TV stops working, and then gives an error message. That the program cannot be looked back and / or that it is not allowed to rinse backwards (when the app has just decided to rinse ahead so that I must miss a piece). Sometimes online TV starts, but with the following program. Furthermore, it works reasonably, so 2 stars then (otherwise it would only have been there)"
"Generally works well, but sometimes the player does not remember where you have remained with playback. Is even more common if you have looked at a recording online and then want to continue through the MediaBox"
Zender always falls on a laptop while logging in
KPN is so accessible as a graftombe. Worthless!
TOP! Nice to look back
The guide does not stand still and goes directly to the left over the screen. Can therefore not click
He does not start the film broadcast very often
"KPN ITV on PC: 
 Subtitles do not work when I click on speech bubble / Istellischewiel. (eg Bijb 'Judas')"
"Can't copy recorded programs on my PC. 
 That is also clear with some programs. 
 But can't watch F1 while it should be possible. Has never been a problem?"
For months problems with the app and website. Loading not decent and the image keeps a falter. Do you pay the main prize here a month?
I can't watch ESPN or Ziggo sport.
Can't look f1
When does the site work again at Safari ?????? It is already a decent time unreachable. It does not stand that Dutch sites such as KPN and NPO have arranged this problem and at the latter's latter problem has not been done for weeks.
"Stopping is a lot less, better moderate so"
He buffer is buffer
"Today's episode, Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen at Spike sticks to 54.59. In addition, you cannot move forward or rewind with looking back. I usually look at NLziet, in this case that is not possible."
"fantastic, now still vasplay for just for the F1 please"
first
Wifi is like better than 1.6kbps
No interactive TV country house
"WiFi is hopeless, I use my phone as hotspot with TMobile everything works. I'm starting to wonder why I have a WiFi modem, actually Uberhaubt why I have KPN. Different returns with customer service and everything should work from KPN side but in practice it unfortunately lies differently. Upload speed regularly drops to 1.6kbs my phone with Tmobile also gives 110 Mbps as hotspot. The app from KPN works great, but there is no option for Windows to the app down L"
The image regularly freezes
It's getting used to but as an emergency solution for second TV gord (sport)
"What is an error code 6001 and I can remedy that yourself 
 On a Raspberry Pi P400"
Why can't I buy a movie with voucher online?
Too bad if you break your program that it is not stored where you left. Also many programs cannot be seen in the app but only via the TV cabinet. App sometimes does not record things when you have checked something for recording. We remain obliged to watch TV through the TV box while we have a smart TV. Too bad a missed opportunity
Just am very happy with it. I can now watch TV everywhere in the house as I am used to.
I have absorbed something but I can't flush it anymore
"If you press a break, and later you want to start to start again, he stuck, you have so many buttons, eg bookmark (nobody knows what it is), sometimes you plan a series, and halfway it stops recording So you sometimes miss a episode. We look through PC - occasionally he says that we can only look back through a case, which we do not have (via TV)."
"Unclear, more complete and up to date with summaries. And, distinguishes in announcement / categories of the summaries. Above all, like the dates of placement at the bottom of the titles of the summaries"
"Simple, clear and well -arranged"
The 'films' pages does not work. I always get a message to try again
"Sometimes you have to log in again and then you also have to set your favorite channels again. This cannot be saved, so that it will automatically come again thereto you are logged in"
I love it when you are on the road just can see some programs
"Little well -arranged. Regular malfunction, then a circle runs in the middle and forget the program where it was ..."
Many improvements possible
nice to watch TV via the PC
"Meanwhile, some good improvements implemented, for which compliments. 
 Now, however, I see at the AT5 / TVNH local channels that playback is not allowed. I think a bit nonsense, nothing commercials. May be because the channel is shared with another channel, I actually know. But it is irritating. If that could be adjusted it would be received with open arms."
very nice
"Have both life TV and recordings tried to watch, but both do not play?"
There is only a blue line around the buttons in which two sides are thicker than the other.
Show better what can be seen online. And whether you can move forward.
I don't see the recordings back if I want to watch KPNITV via my laptop
"That's fast, now everything is there again ...."
"Hello, all my recordings have disappeared. Does not seem at all the intention. Can you reset it again. thanks in advance"
Since a few days I can no longer receive the BBC and the Belgian channels online. Why not?
"1. Too few filters available. 
 Missing: 
 -Films on TV (exists minus or more via now on TV & GT; films, but does not cover the same period as the television guide) 
 - possibility of combining filters, such as: no cabaret (strange that those performances are under the name films) + no children's films for example 
 - recorded films that cannot be seen online, only directly behind the decorer 

 - No possibility of ordering in alphabetical order 
 - No possibility to zoom in on 1 channel, so that you see a complete overview of the programs and not a timeline where you have to scroll horizontally for a long time. 

 - Unclear error messages if something does not work: 
 E.g. An unknown error 6001 has occurred. 
 I don't care."
It often happens that he does not do it despite that we are connected to WiFi. Too bad you can't look back on the website everything you can look back on your television.
Watching a bad online TV does not work
"1 - Situation: search with search field in TV guide, then opening a program of the founder found, then the page with more information about the program close with the 'step back' button. - Problem: After completing the above steps, the previously made search has been removed and all steps must be run again to include another program from the same channel. - Request: When scrolling within the TV guide, the position of the TV guide is saved. Is it possible that the position can also be remembered in the above situation (when using the search field within the TV guide)?
2 - Subtitles TT888 When looking back programs from TV guide and recordings. It would also be nice if it can be designed as on TV in the same format: black background and colored letters to indicate the different speakers
3 - The movie overview of the start page with the films that can be seen on TV today and in the coming days is often incomplete. Often (good) films are often missing, also from Dutch-language channels. If you need help with this: I am accessible via the attached mail address. Like to work for you!
4 - Extensive TV watch tips on the start page and possibly illuminate with a star in the TV guide. If you need help with this: I am accessible via the attached mail address. Like to work for you!
5 - Possibility to postpone this feedback field / form (instead of canceling equal), so that the user can think about it before sending it and that the site then repeated this message a few days later
6 - Again: I would like to work for you, for example to expand TV tips, supplement the movies on TV in the movie overview or to test future versions of the site. Please contact us via the attached mail address!"
"Worthless offer from those 10 free movies in December, in the online tv.kpn.com you see nothing mentioned via plus package movies highlighted and looking for a movie then costs that € 3.99"
"Worthless, no subtitle and the ITV is too low remains wheel running, so that Program stands still"
02
"The Co Mmentaar is ahead of the sculpture. That way you hear the start twice, but the commentators know the intermediate and end times before the viewer sees them. At least I have that. Look via the internet."
Very bad app. Does not work
The umpteenth time I don't get a picture on my PC. Where do I pay for now?
RTL7 does not play in my last Chrome web browser version on Windows 11.
My tablet asks for a Pukcode you can send me badly walking xxx line
"It works well in itself, only the Interlingua option is missing. It is essential in my opinion, especially when I look at sports. Dutch commentator is very bad compared to the American commentator."
If I want to look at channels on interactive then it goes to getting to getting what should I do
Works for no meter.
I often try to log in to watch TVte somewhere but I always get an error message 1001
Great to watch TV abroad
"If you know the jamming of series, it is even better"
"First it worked excellent, now at all anymore: KPN ITV via Firefox browser on Linux Manjaro Gnome"
Works excellent and good quality!
Get arranged error code 6002
Overall a nice service. For me 2 minuses. Start is often clicked so quickly as a result. Saved Gordon Ramsey War in the kitchen is a mess.
"Nice, but stored films continue to hack and / or are distorted considerably, especially via Safari, but also on the iPhone and also when using the databundle instead of the internet"
Do not get subtitles for rent movie
"When starting later, the programs always start after the beginning. That is incredibly annoying that cannot even be adjusted?!"
"Oops, my stored films, etc. is suddenly no longer visible!"
"Today all my stored programs have disappeared, how is that possible?"
Why can't I watch films?
"My favorite channels disappear regularly. I have to reset them again. 
 Option is not to stop in the guide when scrolling to the left and right at the day border, but to switch to the next/previous day."
The connection via my dongle with unlimited data just below the KPN tower in Lelystad is really abominable
Why are the programs from 4-12-21 recorded on the page all with the same picture
The episode Temptation Island 2021 Love or Leave Episode 13 ends in minute 5.
We now get the plus package. Unclear for us is: which movies cost money?
Everything works as it should work. I have not yet been able to find where you can see if your recording capacity is full (saved recordings).
"Sometimes a video remains falter, especially if you have paused it for a while. Then you first have to leave the video and then back to where you stayed in that episode. Otherwise it will not be further."
sometimes break figurines
Why not photos of the programs in stored site
More channels!
good  
"It would be nice as with Series the series that you have viewed one or more episodes, immediately ahead of it as 'recently viewed' or something, so that you can look further episodes without having to search the series again and again."
Unfortunate that I cannot get German channels on the laptop
Fast website good info !!!
"He has not remembered where I left ... 
 I can't even advance to where I have stayed. What to do? I don't want to go and see everything again including commercials (roughly 1.5 hours)"
Some channels are not looking back online even if you pick it up
Perfect I'm happy with it.
"Movie lice mother rented on the TV. Amount 4.99 after completing PIN code., Up to 30 Nov. Trailer can be viewed, but the film is not. Therefore tried on the tablet, but apparently it is independent of each other. Korton is not delivered what has been promised. Not satisfied."
"ITV does not work with Safari on MacBook Pro. 
 With Firefox, but I cannot record favorites in it. (OSX 10.13.6) Recordings are fixed. 

 Favorites will continue to be kept on iPad and iPhone."
Always a fault notification
Too often a program strikes the moment when you stop. That is especially annoying if you want to go on another device in the application of KPN's interactive TV.
Old recording does not want to play and the error message leading to this page is nothing seals
"Also show programs that you record on PC instead of just on TV, ITV because you have other things to look than the rest here, now I still have to look at TV because many programs or not to look back or just watching on TV"
Works perfectly and is well-arranged
Boel gets stuck again
"We use ITV in Spain but very often it does not work because we have an error message unexpected error, try it again later, code 1001, and then we cannot watch ???????"
poor connection
A mandatory number as long as the app works poorly.
"Since November 21, there is always error 1003 when starting watching. Or a Window.undefined. Sometimes there is a few seconds of image. But after that it always gets stuck with error 1003. I have the same problem on the app, only you get no error message there. My WiFi connection is fine, because I can Netflix."
Always bullshit if I want to watch football on the laptop! Terribly annoying !!!
Good
"Sometimes disappoints, a lot of malfunction. And a lot is told"
"Annoying that no subtitles can be switched on. In addition, it is also annoying that the characters for play, stop and wait in the picture appear if a movement is made with the mouse. Does not matter which channel, live or recorded,"
sometimes slow loading and patchy streaming compared to services like Netflix
"Pay 100 euros every month 
 And I'm not waiting here, 
 That regularly resolves my TV on the laptop."
Cannot view recordings
Worthless it ..
"Nevertheless, horribly bales if you really can't look back any top Gear episode without an error message"
Worthless: don't watch web TV or rewind: watch TV everywhere?
"Just think it's a shame that I have recorded programs 
 cannot look at Belgium"
Balen every evening !!!!!!
"I certainly suffer from a block image for both the app and on PC, I have reset everything here but that has helped nothing. Do you have a solution to me?"
"Recording problems with series, strange delays / stolls during playback. Last few months a few things adapted that have made the app better, such as scrolling through the TV guide and stuff"
watch TV online is just a big misery
"Both Live and Looking back / Recordings fairly regularly slow or even full lockers, please save a little better where you were leaving so that you don't have to look a whole episode again."
"Worthless, many recorded programs are not looking back, also live TV BV youth journal does not want to boot."
"Many films are stuck on ITV nowadays. 
 All other fils are doing fine so it is not my internet connection. 
 Todos Los Sabien 
 Horny for Her Trainer 
 Let's Make Love Outside"
It is handy if you absorb something that you can also look back on the same day.
The only thing that is a pity that the German -speaking channels are not available.
"Well organized, well-arranged, more channels (Germany) should be added."
"Can record https://tv.kpn.com/details/21158328.3/Het-block-nieuwzealand do not play, no indication why not"
At a good internet connection fine
"Hello! There is a bug in the looking possibility. If I take a break during looking back, and this takes too long, the app does not remember this. And I have to start looking at the start of the film again. Especially if you are almost at the end of the film, this is rather annoying. It should actually be remembered just like when stopping a recording."
The erotic movies are always stuck but otherwise ok
Very nice that you can watch TV and stored programs in this way. The only disadvantage is that the image and sound after 15 minutes no longer run synchronously and you then have to load the page again to synchronize it again.
"Frequently stands still because the buffer is not sufficient. 
 What is on TV often does not work 
 Image does not always run smoothly"
N / A
Functions very slowly. Too much useless information. Too many layers that you have to see through to see your program.
All my recorded programs and films have disappeared! Miscoys number 50 in 2 days .... Seriously disappointed in KPN.
"Far too slow, too often hitches and even freeze my (new and fast) laptop. In short .... unstable !!"
The slider 'Now on TV' applies abroad for the local time and therefore does not refer to the actual broadcasting time (in the Netherlands).
Top!
often malfunction
Movies from channel package stop after a few minutes.
"Very moderate, fewer channels available than on the TV itself. At Ziggo that is not so that is a reason to switch"
"Since yesterday, the channels (only the channel numbers) are no longer visible in TV guide."
"It's shit if you are in land where 1 hour earlier ... then you can do nothing from the TV guide between 23 and 24 ... e Nsowieso Selecting hassle with correct PGM ... The PGM that turns are indicated If you can record them .... time to build in a time zone ... a pity KPN, despite fan and loyal customer from you"
"well-arranged, preferential stations fine. 
 Looking back also works - Always good. 
 IMDB rating in films would be nice."
Great and reliable
"Why can't I watch goddamn NPO3? It is also always something with that fucking KPN. Program always indicates that an unexpected mistake has occurred. 
 I'll visit the KPN store tomorrow."
"Poor, pages open slow and remain freezing"
"Unfortunately, not stable often faberations"
"It takes infinitely long before the entire page is loaded. Since just over a week, many pages have been incredibly slow, or loading but partially. This is more than annoying, it is unacceptable! 
 Like a fix quickly, or put back an earlier version. With this your customers are chasing away."
Bit messy but functional
"Dear KPN, Why doesn't RAI 1 work? 

 O ha ha ha ha ha"
Many hitches and pages that do not load
"From vacation abroad, I look at a mobile connection (3G) perhaps a possibility to make stream a little less or to be able to choose HD or less"
The image regularly jumps into malfunction
Nice recording
Just super !!!
constantly unwanted breaks during playback
no
Always get an error message cannot watch a film outside of Europe. From Datkpnelfort I have had nothing but problems. Then I'd rather go to Ziggo.
"Now again very very bad connection with your KPN. 
 Do not know why it is but would like to get your serious attention for this and assistance to improvement."
"Too bad you cannot record programs, and a shame you cannot see all recorded programs."
Always malfunction 3016
very good
Why can I no longer play erotic films on the computer. The film stops after about 4 minutes. I have the plus package. And it has worked well until recently.
"often don't look back, also programs that you record on PC only look back via TV ... often change it differently it doesn't work"
Ideal !!
"Good quality, fully offer"
"have not been able to view the end of several episodes / series, then it stops"
Very often interruptions when looking at the saved film 5x in 10 minutes.
I think it's nice both in operation and watch
Download does not work. Not ok.
"If I want to connect with Chromecast, I get to see unexpected error 3016."
I get crazy from error code 1001 !!!!
"Beautiful, easy to use and well -arranged"
"Unfortunately, on my laptop I can't kiss the recorded series and movies from Canvas and BBC First. Is there nothing to do about it? I would really appreciate it. For the remainder fine"
When I open the guide and have chosen a program to go and watch live and then this view it suddenly starts a few minutes earlier or later according to the player very crazy
"Many programs cannot see through malfunction. Can be on telephone, Raaaaarrrr"
Temptation Island Love or Leave doesn't work
bad
Work well and is easy to use
"Often very slow, especially if you want to look something it takes long before it loaded."
Previously the 5 stars! Last 2 weeks each progress that I want to see after 6 minutes. Super annoying. Everything at my laptop already done but nothing works. So it really lies on the app.
What is Error 3016? I cannot watch stored programs.
meh
This really doesn't look nice. 10 times per broadcast I will be thrown out with the notification: an unexpected error has occurred. Please try again later. (1003)
My husband cannot log in to his PC in the login screen he can't type how or whatever he tries honor does not meet any text in the bar where you should type your login and password so please contact about what the problem is
"He regularly hesers but luckily usually good. 
 Separate that your SBS9 cannot look back here."
"Works very well and the menu is easy. Min Point: Is the Player Operation Buttons - In the middle of the image - This is just rude and not graceful 
 2nd thing - it takes too long before the overlay menu disappears - you also have to keep the mouse somewhere out of image other remains the overlay visible. 
 Operation can therefore be more subtle under display, disappear faster and make more logical working by mouse and overlay menu later disappear."
"Day dear kpn I don't want to advise you not to change from login names from KPN TV, this is very very destroying and iritant"
"In the initial phase I suffered a lot of malfunctions, but since 3 weeks I have been a lot of fun. I can now take a look at programs that my wife doesn't look at and they are satisfied on her PC"
"Good afternoon, there is still the possibility to get subtitles at the English-language transmitters of BBC. Through the TV this is possible, but I cannot set it via ITV or I have not left out how this is possible. MVG Karen"
"I searched the film I, Daniel Blake with the search function in the screen on my PC. That film came across twice. The same film, but one came (I think) from my plus package (without costs). The other came from the search for 3.90 euros. That's weird. If you don't pay attention, you can be hunted at cost. How is that possible?"
Works great on my home PC on zip code 3137 yes but on my works 25 km away by post 3197KN. Get Error Code 1001
I cannot set the BBC1 series Strictly for recording and last Sunday's broadcast was not recorded while the entire series was set up. Now the program is unknown from a.s. Thursday!
"Best, 

 Just rented a film for E 5.99. Now it appears that I can't look this because I stay outside the EU. I would like to get this amount to be returned (I am another week outside the EU). 

 Like to hear."
Films does not work when logged in
"Unfortunately, BBC First has a lot of repetitions. 
 The channel offer is fine for the undersigned. 
 Switching to transmitter, it goes smoothly without unumeless delay."
Back and fast forward for films and recordings
"With our internet connection (from KPN) it is almost impossible to look. The videos have been so poorly compressed that a lot of bandwidth is needed. Netflix, YouTube and other video sites do not suffer from this. So it's possible ..."
Very clear and functional.
Why can't I watch football? That is the only reason I pay for this?
Very bad connections is always gone
Internet is not so good the connection often falls away
Make sure it also takes place when I click something to look.
bad falls out
Since the Windows 11 update has hostes the sound.
"Online TV does not work via website, Errorfeldi G 3016. Nowhere to be found what it means."
Different errors tonight. Film has often interrupted
Logged in and can view all screens. Except programs. Then get error code 1001 to see.
I get an error message with code 1001 if I want to watch ITV on my laptop; What's wrong?
The streams sometimes get stuck
Works very good and fast.
Good image quality. Nice that the film will continue where you have stopped and that the advertising can be crossed through.
very well
"The connection to my laptop is regularly broken, so that I have to start the program that I look at again"
Fantastic on the laptop
"Too many broadcasts that I can't watch via my PC, my TV is broken !!! I am very disappointed. I am also not satisfied with the new router, n box 12, what a lousy device, never had such a bad router before!"
"I just switched from Ziggo to KPN. The TV guide screams green in the beam and at the episodes you are there at that time. We are used to looking back and almost always do this. At KPN, it sometimes takes a while before you can look back. The children's lock with which you have to log in before you can see what series there are is very annoying."
"Not all programs are immediately looking back, you often have to wait an extra hour. 
 Image quality, is ... not always 'top' and 'HD', suspect that bit rate is quite low even 
 Transmitters that are not available for subscription should be left away, now unnecessary padding (yes I suspect that that is a trick is, but ... bit irritating)"
Better and better. Desirable the TV guide as an option in vertical position and the possibility to determine the order of the channels in the guide yourself
Can't look on my phone
Why does the pin that works on the TV receiver does not work in the browser? Weird... :-(
Can't watch programs via web
"Can only get NPO 1, 2 & 3 on my laptop but can see all channels in my pakket on the gids screen. Get error 601 when I try to link to anything other than NPO. What about the rest of the channels I'm paying for? Why can't I get them on my laptop as well? Not good!!! Please advise."
Why doesn't subtitles (TT888) work?
"Sometimes stop the connection, very unfortunate. Or may I not look."
"It is nice to see the series so back. It's a shame it doesn't remember wherever you log in and that it always continues to falter, this happens especially if you want to look back a program from the TV guide, but it will also be on the Internet vd KPN"
"Favorites and other institutions cannot be captured with Firefox on MacBook Pro OSX 10.13.6. 
 I cannot log in at all in Safari"
"I often come home after twelve time and look forward to looking back at the journal of twelve hours. To my surprise, I see that this program can no longer be seen. Very annoying"
Every minute I get the error code 1003 OID
Always get the error message 3016 on my iPad and therefore can't view anything. Extremely annoying. What should I do to avoid this?
"Don't get the channel I want. wants transmitter of the month, but get repeats from the NOS Journaal, that should be under a different button. 
 I don't leave my address, the problem is clearly loose. (was once last week last week) 
 I find much more important than an employee who calls 'Oh, a bit annoying for you'"
b
program continues to load
Runs too often. Series disappear from recommended list. And too much of the recorded / stored programs cannot be played online.
"What a pathetic affair, plus package but at WebTV a hand full of over, no Belgium no BBC no Germany etc. 'Watch TV everywhere' misleading, and the channels available at the filter will also simply become the unavailable. Sometimes also weak signal. First Class Prices, yes that."
Watch regularly unnecessarily during the TV
"Works perfectly, but do not use when you are on mobile. Only when you are on the WiFi. That is due to sublime image quality."
"Not yet stable enough to really make me happy (buffering) at a download speed of 93.2 Mbps. Where did KPN's technical superiority remained? I am willing to pay for that, but then it must be top! Do I have to doubt whether I am at the right provider?"
"If we press 'movies', we get an 'unexpected error'"
Constant the error message 1001
Works very well. In the TV guide it is not very easy to scroll. There are of course a lot of channels. Perhaps there are possibilities to facilitate use here
"IT SUCKS! 
 Work incredibly bad. The guide shows almost nothing, and if something appears, you can only ""scroll a few hours of windshield or backwards. 
 I have to use here because the app needed an update and turned out not to be reinstalled ('not available in your ...') !!"
Find it annoying that at midnight I can't go through in the TV guide to the next day. Must then click the next day and continue there
Always TV without a malfunction
Very good
"Often gives an error message on the initial screen that makes no sense, because there is nothing wrong at that time."
Moderate quality. Just like the app. Often loss etc.
Now notification 3016
"I am very satisfied with ITV could not live without it. 
 But if you are busy on series recording, I find it annoying that if the season ended at, for example, the Detective series Vera on RTL 8 on Friday you have to enter the series recording again. Then the season recording is not called series recording. Maybe Julie can change that or warn people. Very satisfied for the rest."
"I just rented a movie. Can't find anywhere where it has remained. 
 Only with the search function is. And by the way I could not enter the code nowhere to see the Pathe at home Folm before October 31 before half the price. What to do?"
500.ref code. Not 1 time but very often
He constantly flies out. Does not work well.
Claims! After failure you can't look back and when time is over at all anymore! Ziggo is 10x better!
Drama in Spain to look
"After the last update, there is a feature in which a item is enlarged with Hovering. Again a formal aspect that is a functional deterioration. 
 Extra with the mouse must be pushed to operate the functionality that previously required, and there is a disruptive indicator in the image. That makes it restless, bad to see, and it leads to it. 
 Who has come up with this kind of jugs should only be added? It starts to look like the software should be entertainment on its own. But it's just an app to watch TV. 
 Please go back to the base and the designers and programmers who devise this kind of filament to offer a function elsewhere. Something in art or something. 
 This is now just throwing away money."
"Since the recent updates, loading pages from the main menu has been strikingly longer than before. Gray surfaces can be seen for too long. That is disturbing and annoying. 
 Again you have succeeded in making changes that are deteriorations. Tribute for your consession in this (not)."
"Good service. I improve: If you are logged in, please make all channels available to watch (back) regardless of the location. We have 1 KPN account for home. But are also often in another house of us. But we cannot watch all channels there."
"I have the idea that the buffering is not completely running well. I have a fast internet connection, and my PC is wired on my network, but sometimes still buffer problems. And I wondered why the resolution is automatically at 720 and not at 1080 ..."
A broadcast can only be seen after a while. Something of fifteen minutes or half an hour. That is very annoying. Often I am just too late and then have to wait until I can watch.
Why can't I use all functions on my laptop in accordance with my subscription?
Why is it only possible to look back on a limited number of films online and not all the films I have recorded? It is only a pathetic number of films that look back through Inter Active TV.
It is a shame that it is constantly stuck.
I want to pause with space bar
"I find that when you take a recording on pause, then do not want to play further. You have to click back to recordings and recording that you look at. He remember where you left."
Too bad that not all recordings on the PC or phone can be viewed. But for the rest fine
Many malfunction and long waiting for recovery in other words wait long and not happy with this explained online and WiFi must start on and over again. m.vr.gr.
"Great diverse programs 
 Remarkably, an individual complains about the switches of the pedestrian crossing too much noise size and the reaction to it, beautiful."
"If he has been on a break, he walks a little later"
With certain channel I always get an error message 3016
"Personally, don't think it's no improvement for KPN, probably but not for customers."
"Strange that, while I look at ITV a few times a week, I regularly have to log in again. And then my favorite channels have suddenly disappeared. 
 Very annoying !! 
 But nice that there is now a beam next to the TV guide, with which you can scroll to the other channels!"
"Everything that saved has also been able to watch online. 
  Often malfunction is sometimes hanging."
"In general, it works well, sometimes after a longer pause he forgets the point and you can only look again from the beginning, which is mainly annoying with many advertisements, I always skip through; ) Furthermore, app that I use every day, very happy with it"
"Excellent site; Use it daily. Too bad that some programs can only be seen through the receiver i.p.v. on the PC. 
 Program offering is great!"
"Often the image remains and with some channels the sound is bad, it is certainly not due to the connection of the internet because I did the speed test and it was fine"
"Just bought the Formula 1 on TV for 1 episode. 
 Then I want to look further at Labtop. Hereby I will always be forwarded to buy complete sports package from 14.95 / month. 
 This should be able to do it differently !!"
Why can't I see a bought formula 1 match on my iPad? I pay 6 euros for the race and then I find out that this is only available through the TV. This while the rest of my family wants to look at the TV to Expedition Robinson. I really think this is a very bad thing and would like to receive an explanation for that
Only consume that there is a problem 1001?
"Nothing to change, is ok"
Very bad reception
KPN Online TV does not work on computer error
"I get error message 1001, I cannot watch TV via my laptop for a long time"
Clarity and good info
Strange that at channel of the month simply displays NPO1 instead of the promised crime transmitter. I think the basic subscription is already expensive enough and this is not what you can expect from KPN.
"It should not be caused by complaints being understandable, but it often happens that I look back a program, and halfway when a problem occurs. Because of this I have to start looking again, but it is impossible to flush through so you first have to look back half the program before you can continue. This happened 3x yesterday."
"I can only reach the site in the non-secured mode. What can I do to change that? I even have this problem on 2 computers, on my MacBook from 201 and on my iMac. Both run on version 10+"
Watching TV via television.xs4all.nl Viasafari and Google Chrome gives error messages ao Problem with playback video (13016) and other error numbers are also displayed. How come? What can I do to get a solution for this?
It would be nice if all channels are also available online (back)
Before
"Works great, also abroad"
"In general good, points for improvement: Support multiple languages (eg English commentary at Eurosport) and the guide that does not go through after 11:59 pm"
"Great invention. 
 Super nice!"
"It's good but have many faltering images, have a good PC and have already been along KPN Barendrecht. Had many tips but still works badly!"
Why can't I log in
"Very much malfunction. If you look back with a program and the site turns off again on a fault, you can start fully overewner because windscreen rinses to where you have stayed again. Because of this you go to Netflix or another service. I went for a long time pro KPN but finds the services to be desired lately. I also consider to switch when I am moving next month."
Does what to do
How can I solve error code 3016?
awesome
Does not work in Spain at all. Both the app and website just don't work.
"I can only watch TV alone if the resolution is low and as soon as I switch it to medium or high, I will immediately see a rotating loading symbol or before you roll up an update then I can be done by means of a high resolution in advance Watch TV without faltering but after the update again I don't have to put the resolution low again"
Unexpected malfunction ?? So I can't watch TV online
I can't see ESPN on laptop a bit weird
Clear and easy to use
"Weird that at booting first 0:00 is loaded and only the right time later. Furthermore, the black circles in the middle of (back-pause-forward) disturbed."
Find it very pleasant to be able to look back on the films / series.
It is fast and clear
The oops there went something wrong app
not to look at always stops
"Now I switch to another channel, and should rifle set those FAVO channels ??? 
 Why can't this remain standing?"
"When the WiFi connection is lost and restored again, the page relies automatically and continues with the live broadcast. This is annoying if the broadcast has been paused."
"I would like to know why I have to watch advertising for some channels with previously recorded films or programs. It is not that I get ITV free from KPN. This scheme is also meaningless with the channels, because I am looking at a Christmas advertising in the summer or to an expired action of a supermarket. If KPN gets money from the relevant channels, it is even more reprehensible. If that is not the case, KPN can easily refuse, because how do they get their broadcasts to the man? †"
"Why do I have to look online every time I want to look online, why can't this be saved ????? Ben Bnoos! Can't you solve this problem ????? I find it very annoying to have to set up again every day !!!!! And no, I don't have to log in Elka day!"
Awesome
Nice watch TV on my laptop wherever you want. Good quality
"Works perfectly, just watch TV and record it awakens"
There is nothing but malfunctions if you are sitting do you have to wait until the program will continue
"What I do is wrong that you can set to switch to a selected channel if the program that you want to see !! 

 The function remember / automatically switch over x minutes"
"The TV Experience has become a lot better, yet when looking back, the program is sometimes skipped in the last few minutes. The stream should also go through when the program has ended. The back button at the top left is when you get out of fullscreen next to the back button in window mode ... but I am more satisfied, is better than a year ago .."
"Very unfortunate that the button to record a program is no longer, this was very handy if you are from home and want to look back later"
Very poor collaboration with Google Cast. Only through the screen of the PC / laptop to casting is watching a broadcast without significant interruptions due to buffering (from the phone I don't even try anymore)
"If VPN from McAfee has been enabled this has happened since today, be outside the EU."
"Hope someone reads this. Recently when I come to TV.kpn.com, the page must load 2x. Pretty annoying. You come as standard on the day of yesterday and you go to 'now'."
Unfortunately it is necessary for me to look something from the TV but zap and more is not possible.
"Always stay stuck at the same time in an advertising block, a cdrom is like a scratch"
"The page works well and regularly updated. 
 I'm very satisfied with it."
a lot of malfunction lately roming
"Worthless falls off. Can no Belgian channels look back and not to see German channels at all. If you get an error message you cannot resolve them because the error message is not found. This is not mentioned anywhere, you have only fallen behind as a subscriber."
I'm within the EU
"Usually it works great. However, if you put a stored file 'too long' on a break, then the traffic jam will no longer continue. Some files cannot be loaded 'apparently'. Yesterday I wanted to see EK Darts that I had admitted on Thursday; That file did not want to load 'Try it again in a few minutes'. That turned out not to help either. In addition, it is not clear in advance which programs (channels?) Can be included, but not played via KPN ITV."
"Interrupts, sometimes slow. You can collect it on the laptop but it is very difficult on mobile"
He often sticks and I cannot watch regularly if the recording is still running
"Would not be better if certain channels (such as SBS9) would not have a blockage on playback. 
 It is also weird if you record programs and you cannot flush them to the following subject, by weather blockade from channel (RTL4 News) 
 I am very happy with this possibility and I often use it. 
 It would be nice that the saved capacity indicated at Online TV in browser is also shown in Android version and on the regular TV."
Bamboo
Top service. Easy to operate. Shooting. Back to top handy. Pause function good. Remembering a nice place. A lot to look back.
"It is great that mobile awaiting this is made possible. 
 It requires a good / fast internet connection to get smooth reception."
"Through this way I try to indicate that I still get invoices on the old Ziggo email address. My current address has been since November 2020: mw_lengkeek@kpnmail.nl 

 mvg m.lengkeek"
Nice that this is possible
"I can't look back almost nothing, what's possible on TV. In my view even worse than Ziggo Go !!!"
Fine. Too bad it's only 1 week looking back.
Signal is too weak. Transmitter always stands out
Too bad that not everything is back and that the program stops at too long. Too bad I cannot look back.
Many TV channels can only be viewed via the TV. Pity.
Great arranged
"The split ups of programs have now become far too short, so that the start or end is not included in the admission. That is annoying. For this it was much and much better. Another example of: change is deterioration."
"If I open website for MTV after opening, I get 3 channels in the picture. Nice, I choose MTV 80's then you expect that I will watch life .. But no I get a program guide, MTV 80's not in the picture, search again then you can finally choose. Cumbersome right?"
"Bundle extended but internet speed low !! Remains low / slow 
 plvbeers@kpnplanet.nl"
The program increasingly runs
The recording menu could be clearer.
It would be nice if there would be subtitling with every series because of people who are deaf and want to look back.
"Super, use it every day since I'm included in a nursing home."
that everything can be played
very well
"bad, often slow, a lot of malfunction, and failure"
Switching between transmitter is too cumbersome. Too much click and slow.
I always get a fault message on my iMac. Now I cannot use TV online. why not
Good
flashy site
I always use it
Make sure it works
The number of 'unexpected errors' is countless since the fiber optic connection !!!!!!!
"Is good, but it is not always synchronous with me"
"Why can you look back almost everything, except my favorite series Silent Witness. 
 At Ziggo, that was possible"
goes perfectly
"Works well, is well-arranged and easy to use."
Worthless speed is too low and green round stay
Now I suddenly can no longer take a recorded Looking back Formula 1 cafe. Very unfortunate this !!!
Before!
it is a shame that not to see everything just like at home
KPN must work on the connection! Sometimes I can't look back or the broadcast is interrupted. It then takes too long before the problem has been resolved!
Connection sometimes falls away
Very good
"Recording goes very well, it is also clearly indicated how you can view and play them, and it is remembered where you are when you stop watching so that you can see later where you left. The TV guide is not clear, you see the program of a few channels and there is no gray bar on the side with which you can scroll up and down, so that must then be very awkward with the arrows on the keyboard. 
 You can also look at the TV guide for English and Belgian channels a few days ahead, which is very difficult, so that you have to see again every few days if something interesting in the coming days will come. When recording the English channels is not subtitles, which is also very difficult !!"
"On online use, the subtitles of eg a Dutch-language film that is included is not working"
"Now there are a number of channels that can only be viewed via the decoder (German channels, English, regional channels). This should also be made accessible to view the laptop or PC via the app or at home"
Switch more easily from transmitter and rinse forward or backwards
"This is certainly the 5th times since we came back from France last Sunday. Again that the TV code indicates to restart the modem 
 Again no WiFi in France we never have that problem. I am starting to hate KPN more and more"
Watching TV online at work almost never succeeds.
"Many malfunctions (current image) 
 Many manipultie at early moments with looking back. 
 Many clicks needed to erase a recording. 
 Provider (KPN) clearly acts as a party involved in setting choices, as an advertiser with interests in specific institutions."
"It is especially useful to sit in locations where there is no possibility to watch wired television, but the internet is available ..."
"Great app, look more than on TV :)"
Does what it should do is clear and always works.
Sometimes the page remains when you let a program still stand still (on pause)
Too often malfunction
Super bad
It does not work. He always says: an unexpected mistake has occurred. Please try again later. (3016)
That it is annoying that the commercials can all be seen but that the TV series is silent for the 2nd time
pussy
Perfect
It works well in itself. Only the sound que volume has become lower lately.
Why can't you play all stores TV programs on the laptop and tablet?
Why are the German channels not to receive on the laptop or tablet?
I usually look at recordings via Online TV. Long not all my recordings can be viewed on tables / laptop and that is different from I would expect (having to kpn spots / commercials).
"Wonderfully looking back, I often have not given the opportunity to watch live"
Some recorded programs cannot look at the computer. That is irritating
"I record many movies on the desktop and it wants to see what then suddenly is not possible. I get the message that you can only play the recording on the TV? What has in the desktop then for sense? Moreover, it does not assume; ""You can record this movie but only watch TV."" Very sloppy."
"Connection is slow, via WiFi still 4G to get improvement."
"TV offer is already summary, now I apparently don't even look back half, still ff and I say my subscription, YouTube and videoland have more offer"
"In the scheduled recordings the recordings are wrong. Conversely, chronological instead of chronological. If a recording is ready I must first refresh website before I can play it. TV guide can only be used horizontally. TV guide is awkward to use."
Too bad you can't view all channels recording
"Nothing works, a star because it must. Would there be negative stars at places or red."
Sometimes the connection falls away. Seems to buffering. Is 50 MB not sufficient? It was indicated when contracting contract that this will not be the case.
"Good overview, too bad that everything revolves around money again with regard to channel packages."
"In recent months TV does not work online as it should. It seems as if only Ned 1, 2 and 3 start up without problems. The rest of the channels do not start or try it up afterwards. Error message 1001"
Sometimes it doesn't work so well
"Viewing another device is not possible 
 Not all shows are looking back (e.g., the transporter, some broadcasts that had taken place was not shown) 
 With the necessary channels you cannot play back to the start of the program if you are going to look shortly after the starting time. 
 Program runs rather during a broadcast and then the last looked position was not saved and you had to leave the program from the beginning. 
 A recent episode of the Transporter R was not fully displayed when looking back. Halfway through the broadcast suddenly starts a subsequent broadcast .. 
 In summary so actually very dissatisfied with this web application. 
 Also a decline T.O.v. Our earlier Program EyeTV where we could record programs from a program guide and later can look back and no commercials had to look."
"Clear information, but switch between programs takes a long time. Stability sometimes leaves something to be desired, such as 'looking back' yesterday evening."
Just not well always ppppfffff
"Occasionally jerky image, but for the rest excellent reception"
Bad I can no longer log in after the update
LOVE IT
Why should I suddenly log in again and have all my recordings disappeared?
"I miss a scrollbar on the right, can scroll through time, but not down the channels ..."
"Great, so convenient that I can view everything I can take on my TV everywhere, on desktop or laptop, and vice versa. TV to-go!"
Just top
"I cannot boot the films, gives a window that there is a problem."
"I get the message that I cannot watch TV outside the EU, but I am in Sweden, that's EU. It did succeed at the beginning of the week. 
 No. 20000004653414"
"The app was much clearer and easy, in the horizontal mode. Why do it change?"
Why no German channels in the app
The Hapert image app is always impossible. So we thought we are going to TV.kpn.com but we can also not look back with the recorded series or error codes or Hapert
"I always get the message unexpected error 3016, which is of course not fun"
"Watching TV via the laptop / desktop is pleasant. We look at recorded programs in order of broadcast date and luckily that can still be done via this site. Why only 3 stars that has to do with TV watch through digital TV on television. KPN has adjusted the recording menu, so that our recording is automatically displayed in series. This makes it very unclear to us. We have contacted customer service by telephone. The answer was that this has been implemented with the latest update because this is experienced by KPN as a clearer. According to us, the customer's preference must be leading and not what is taken from investigations and determined by KPN. The choice to determine your own design for recording menu themselves would have been more customer-friendly. Hopefully this choice will be added. We unfortunately consider to switch to another provider if the design cannot be adjusted to our viewing preference."
"On the iPad since IOS15 update I can only view the NPO channels. Notorious error message 3016. On the Macmini desktop, 'Everything' functions ...."
"On the news, the images become so strange that we can only see a piece of face of the people and that since the beginning of August"
"I wonder why on earth I cannot watch recordings of, for example, BBC (First) via the De Laptop, while recorded programs from other channels are available. The first-mentioned recordings can apparently I can only watch at home via the TV Onvanger. Strange and certainly not customer -friendly with a not cheap subscription. Regular watching of 'foreign' TV channels (think of the Belgian channels) is not possible abroad. Ziggo is doing much better with their go app in that regard. I believe that your offer is scarce in this regard and not appropriate to your status. For the price I pay, I want to be able to use all services everywhere."
"Really super Duke r, banana and happiness, not scroll TV guide Grrrrrr alone. Don; t Why Know. Laptop not good? Am the best, KPN also 'doesn't know watover.ga by zoo, yes yes"
"Why can't I play some recordings on my tablet or laptop, but only on the TV receiver ??"
Can't watch programs. Remains forever loading on the preview. Internet just works great.
"View recording only on TV receiver ..... 

 Why?"
"After restarting a computer, the TV guide page appears to be drastically changed. A change like this is not an improvement. A useless scrollbar to move 7 out of 9 lines and not to choose a program line? Shoe seller Humor? Make a horizontal and vertical scollbar and give the mouseepointer a contrasting color, for luminent red. 
 The changed page doesn't even show the person icon to also give feedback and more ..."
Why can't I see canvas recording 'the ideal world' via app or safari iOS? (Undoubtedly rights issue but handsome annoying)
Connection is always disappearing and connection is very slow
"The app is reasonably annoying T.O.V home situation: 
 Firstly, I cannot scroll down on the TV guide page, except if I happen to have a touch screen, and in addition it's an annoying that I cannot look back a program that I have recorded earlier in the evening without through the Complaints must be sitting. I take some programs because I want to avoid that."
Outside the EU with the internet cannot view your own recorded film just thick shit !!!
"My favorite channels have disappeared. I get really tired of the name KPN and the Special Buggy delivery compared to Hetnet (it was also not flawless, but it seems that you are doing it)"
"Sorry... 
 Something went wrong. Refresh the page by clicking on this button and try again. 
 Extra tips to solve the problem: 
 Close the tab and open the page in a new tab 
 Log out and again 
 Remove all cookies for tv.kpn.com"
Enable ESPN WATCH?
"Ziggo has politics today on a separate channel why don't KPN not? French channels? 
 Now we have to do it via interslet on a PC .2021 How then?"
Sound is often bad. and often error codes
"TV remains too often hang, then the image does not follow the sound or vice versa. Come on it's 2021, citizens to the moon but you are currently withdrawn? You can get crazy that fewer people watch TV, it doesn't have to be that hard"
Apparently KPN thinks that I am outside the EU: I can't view anything. I'm just in Europe.
"I can't scroll down the TV guide, I have to reduce the image so that it is illegible to get all channels. I look considering BBC and so cannot click it."
I have nothing to view WebTV if I can only view stored programs at home.
Get always message doesn't try a try later
Success!
Henze is the fastest
Sjoerd is the best
Always stopping the movie
"Still worthless after 1/2 hours 
 watch TV"
Why can't I watch the Ajax-Cambuur competition right now?
Work bad abroad
"He still buffers regularly on Windows 10 PC Despite fiber optic, try to solve that first"
"It is very annoying, but the image freezes regularly !!!"
stupid
Looking from the start does not work: is not from the start. I often have to scroll to the beginning plus wrestling through the advertising
"In particular, looking back is poorly programmed. 
 I cannot change a film regularly because it takes too long due to the amount of advertising. The following day look at the start of the start and again !!! 
 Please fix this"
YatsFC l
Why does the signal get away and I have to view the program again from the front?
"Poor abroad, unnecessary error messages for data interruptions, after error message you must reload the site."
"Is always gone. Is not free to wifi. That's good! There is something every time Oops is going wrong !!! Irritating. Delete history, all-off and then the image comes again."
Does not work
doesn't get any picture at all at all
Why can't I watch recordings out of your house
hopeless
worthless
worthless connection to KPN
"Again malfunction, here I pay 72, - Euro PMD. for !!!!!"
Does t
nice
Free movie in September gift don't work
"I have just new iPhone and iPad, but I cannot log in via the app. It is indicated that this is temporarily unable and that it is possible with a subscription number. This is also not possible. Couple of days ago it didn't work."
"Works very poorly, is constantly attached."
Picture often stands still with ErrorMeldimg (11003)
buffering is always wrong than ITV is flying out
I have a very strong suspicion that with KPN Unlimited is not unlimited. This week it has already happened three times that there was no longer a internet connection. We are in South Limburg.
Often very bad reception .. Internet via Ziggo and another WiFi amplifier and still shit ..
worthless
"What a Toboy nowadays, the most annoying error messages about typo while I click on an item ?? !! XS4ALL, War are you? KPN $% ^ # @@ $ ^ &"
"Something worthless. Just get notifications that it doesn't work """

Very bad falls out 10 times a night.
"It is always worthy away, the 1/2 hour thank hopeless afterwards"
I can only only get Ned. See 1 2 and 3 on my laptop. For me I could see all channels. There are 2 devices connected and that may be 5. What is the problem?
Why don't you notice that a different site should be logged in?
Test
very bad reception
"On vacation camping with WiFi Luxembourg and cannot watch TV on a laptop and mobile. 
 On mobile he gives this video not available and with data he does. 
 with laptop error code (1001} and no image 
 likes to solution"
worthless
Worthless to give an 'unexpected' error. I don't pay a lot.
I still get feedback back
My image does nothing at all stands still on TLC
Why can't I look back on TLC never bothered why now is a bale of this
Watching back from the senior voice is currently not possible i.v.m. A malfunction on the laptop. Like to solve.
"The image remains black, but noise ... also on the lowest image quality."
"It is annoying that the system seems to log you out If you have the broadcast on a break for a while, if you look on it goes well and then the image freezes with a round -rotating round. You then have to log out yourself (above right) and then log in again and then it works again."
"I recently see in the TV guide of the webtv no more color bar that indicates how far a program has progressed. Also when looking back, the color bar has disappeared for calling the position. Is that a known problem?"
"I can't even give 1 star, so cunt it is. Never had so many error messages. WiFi works great, because Netflix and prime video are just doing, just that shit system from you! Maybe you can do something about it because we pay good money for it!"
pathetic
"Recording plans failed (ACN_3000) 
 Why can't I record (Grand Prix)"
"I can't look at the browser 
 Google Chrome version 93.0.4577.63 (Official Build) (64-bit) 

 I can log in and view my recordings, but if I want to play a will I get an error message: an error has occurred 1001. 
 That happens with all recordings"
"Does not work abroad! Okay, WiFi is not very fast here, but Netflix and prime video work great. Only KPN is k * t with pears! Retete, continues to stream a program of 50 minutes lasting lasts 1 1/2 hour, to remain silent from all those error messages ........"
"Nothing happens when starting a TV program. It doesn't matter if I am connected via the WiFi or through a hotspot. 
 Have also removed the app once and reinstalled, but unfortunately it doesn't work .. 
 I am now on my holiday address and cannot use it, very annoying and I am very minimalist. Say that I am not talking about it at all, just bad. 
 I do expect some feedback from you."
"It must also work in the EU, but it doesn't work on Gran Canaria."
Why can't you receive the German channels online and on the TV?
"Why are there only 8 episodes from Clarice, while the season consists of 13 parts?"
The (in English) subtitles of recordings of the BBC would be useful. The same applies analogous to TV5ETC
Watching online doesn't work. Start up but immediately closes with error code 3016 and with text it later try again
Hapert all the time
"Always still image, then a count good and still for a very long time. Very annoying this."
"Problem with recurring notification: 

 'An unexpected error has occurred. Please try again later. (1001) ' 

 And that on every transmitter ....... 
 (Adblockers are out, use Chrome browser."
Does not always make error code available temporarily 1001
"Poor system, always stops during broadcast, nothing can follow, both on Chrome and on Edge"
The image quality of NOS is poor compared to other channels. Is that to improve?
Where are episodes 9-13 from Clarice?

 The stage is as shown on the official page 197.8km and not 187km.

Then I think a lot of people are interested in this package, even if that will cost EUR 5 per month because you can see F1 live. Certainly interesting for KPN because Ziggo loses the broadcast rights next year and new provider Viapay probably will probably want to sell directly subscriptions"
You still can't scroll down in the browser to see other channels on the TV guide. very sorry.
I can find ITV no teletext for subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing
"When looking back, Air Crash Investigation is fixed"
Does not work. Then also price increase.
"Online TV works, but already have about a day that the ITV no longer works."
You can do different channels (if you have recorded something) on the computer but only on the TV such as the SBS9 channel
streams bad
English for Ziggo Sport etc would be really good. The Dutch comment is just really bad: C
Ridiculous that I always have to log in at home ...
Why can't I look back this program? Yet it is ridiculous that it can and not via KPN via KPN or will you pay the costs for NLzite back?
Displays any time error message 6012 on Edge Chromium. PLEASE FIX THIS
I would like to see everything on my PC / tablet just like on the TV
Worthless. Despite super fast internet almost always slow or no image.
"Unfortunately, I almost get a connection with I TV

"Doesn't work, why?"
"Be sure to try it 10 times to log in and always get the message Sorry there went something wrong.

What can be wrong? Can't watch TV on this computer.
ITV Online does not work all afternoon
"such a bad site .... constant not available, really worthless !!!"
Mobile app does not work ..... if you need it.
My channel package has been adjusted and then fail to watch KPN TV on my PC.

Cannot watch TV online. Always get an error message. The annoying is that it is not reported about what is possible on hand. And or how to solve.
An unexpected error has occurred. Please try again later. (t.userplexDedRatings is undefined)
That app doesn't work
KPN ITV does not open. (don't watch possible)
Your television is an absolute disaster! I don't understand that we will still pay you money. I pay for watching television and I can't watch television. Give me a good argument on which I have to stay with your club any longer? Is the rest even worse? What a drama that KPN! We have tried everything; Nothing works! Help us once!
Works very badly lately
Why does something go wrong?
"Stops often, and recently you will receive an error message when logging in."

"Malfunction, pages are not built up all day, no recorded programs can see and cannot record programs. In short ...... you have nothing to do today."
Episode 2 does not do it from villa orange
"I am surprised that I cannot rent a movie via the KPN ITV App. Now I rented the film (Life of Pets 2) via the browser TV.KPN.com, but this was 1 euro more expensive. € 4.99 instead of € 3.99. In addition, I cannot watch the film on my TV in those 48 hours. I would find it more user -friendly if the rented film can be rented everywhere (TV/app/browser), for the same price and everywhere you can look back in the rental period."
"I can bake. Do not look back on programs while looking back. 
 I can also. Not included movies on my phone. 
 I think this is very annoying. 
 So I can't see what I want."
"Image and sound is fine, however, I am with a problem. I use a Presonus audio 22 VSL, and the audio is not sync with the video. Can I do something about this?"
Voice and image on all BBC recordings are not synchronized. Is there something that I can do it or is it up to you?
"Day, 
 I'm just having to look at snackmasters, the end approaching, the envelope with the name of the winner is opened ... and the image pauses and jumps to the next program. Very program looked and no idea who the winner. Again. Always when a program has almost ended (usually during the denouement) the image stands still and it will continue with the following program. Super frustrating. This was never that way, why now ???? 
 P.S. fine if you also get a comment when promptback is asked .."
Why is the subtitles on every time?
"I want to look back on programs with certain channels but this is not possible, despite the indication on the website that this should be possible. No information is given about how to look back these programs. I would like to receive more information about this (and I want to look back without having to think in advance if I want to take a program or not)."
"If Rutte cannot remember by pressing what he is doing, then he is simply not suitable for his job.

Can't look back. Only error messages
Image and sound do not always run lip synchronously. I would like to see an opportunity to adjust this.
"It regularly happens that when I look back on a day earlier, the program crashes"
Where can I change my password TV?
"I always have to log in, that should not, because I live alone and that wasn't that time. 
 I also get to see a child lock, I have to introduce my code, but why there are no children at all here, I live alone"
"How can I save something on a USB stick that I have recorded and want to keep? 
 There is a USB port on the TV receiver"
"I thought I had missed program, I can't look back, bale bale"
"The recording of the block cannot therefore not be followed, too bad"
On the website you must be scheduled to sort recordings by dayf or transmitter. For sorting on day the current day first and then the following day etc
"Worthless connection with logging! I have already mentioned Hie. If this last longer, I would like to cancel my contract"
"It is crazy for words that 26,50s can be ordered without a check!"
"I look lego masters on the cupboard, put it on pause, and when I return the traitors are busy. I returned to Lego Masters, I can't spray until where I stayed. I try through the site a 'sorry' report as always. Site is also no longer in 1080p. Is really thinking about cancellation, sorry."
"Does not work on my PC, what a clutter always with apps and PCs with KPN ITV, really completely below level that you could expect from KPN"
Does not work on iPad !!!
Does not work on iPad Whoops error and weather
How can I adjust my password?
Can't open a page. Works slowly.
"Best, 
 I am currently sitting on St Maarten for 3 weeks. Last 3 weeks I could watch TV without problems from my laptop by using KPN ITV. But suddenly this is no longer possible, would you help me with that? 

 Thank you in advance?"
Commercial channels no longer work like RTL4 at the top of the menu a code 6012 is displayed. It concerns Windows.IPadd works well.
"What is a pussy with online TV. 
 September every day. Still image, poor reception. 
 Worthless so-called."
"I can't watch TV via the ITV website. Can you indicate where that is about? 

 I get an error message with code 1001 and the question to try it later."
"Image is regularly fixed. The internet connection and speed is fine (tested with speed test and wifi manager), different browsers attempted with Netflix or NPO never start problems. Worthless!!"
"That the internet connection in our apartment hasn't been okay for years and that still that ... but you always increase the price but the internet is jerk ... 

 It is not even 1 star value let your service, I stopped contacting with you because it doesn't help anything !!"
My new Acer falls off every time I look football at KPN ITV
"Audio is rather than video, unfortunately not in sync."
Too bad you can't see everything if you have included it.
"Upon look back I always get an error message. 3016 
 Can this be remedied?"
And again a program stops and jumps back to the beginning of the previous program and you cannot rinse ahead to where you were. Thought that misery was resolved.
Normally very good but I can already watch TV a few days .. always gives an error code
My programs used to be saved and I could see which I had included. Now that is no longer possible if I have them at home on admission.
Image and sound are not synchronized. Highly annoying
"If it works, it does well. Otherwise the app only runs to load, both on the phone and the laptop. Go wrong more often than good. Very sin."
Veronica Inside from yesterday keeps on looking back
"Nice that it is a bit civilized now. 
 Thank you!"
I am in France and BBC One and Two are not available and I don't know why?
"KPN ITV functions on my laptop in the caravan in NL for no meter! I can only look at the first 6 channels in the guide! Continuous problems, also with playback of recordings. KPN clearly states that you can look at all your devices !!"
Too many login screens
"In general, watching TV online works well. Occasionally it happens that when just looking back, the broadcast is suddenly demolished with the message that Vissing is not allowed (RTL 4). Apparently there is a hitch in that program, because when both rewind and look back and look back and look back from the start, it yields the same error message at exactly the same point in the broadcast. It is then impossible to rinse past the problem and to view the rest of the broadcast. This occurs when looking back at various programs, but I have never had it during the live TV."
After years of chromecast technology it still works for no fell. Shame on you
Look up and enter and enter every time. it is crazy about it
"If this is also permitted when this is also permitted, the page will remain. Spontaneously standing still program."
"I would like to have an option to see history back (when did you look at something) and something like a watch list of film / series that I want to see. 
 Actually just like Youtube"
Guide is not correct at all
Every time my favorite channels lost :-(
Error 3016 !! What does that mean?
"Shit, if this stays that way I switch to Ziggo. Since a few days of serious problems to watch TV online on my laptop. I activated extra package Ziggo Sport to watch F1."
Very annoying that channels are constantly being added and disappear a little later. very amateurish
Don't get a picture.
"Image is jerky, for example at tennis on ESPN that is especially annoying"
Better than Ziggo
I miss the function to change a password
"An unexpected error has occurred, try again later (1001). What is this? 
 Tried again later but does not yet work. Why doesn't it work ????"
"The sports page of your site always solids since I completely turned on ESPN. Don't know if there is a connection, but it is awkward."
No connection for sport !!!!
"After 2 hours unfortunately, the next notification if I press TV at TV.KPN.com .... - & GT; An unexpected error has occurred. Please try again later. (undefined is not an object (evaluation. ""E.Resultobj.containers.length""))"
"I cannot load KPN ITV, get an error, 25 minutes ago Ziggo Sport added"
Works badly. Code 3016 appears regularly and regrets the cancellation of Ziggo. That app works flawlessly. Solution of this 3016 problem is still not given
"KPN app on computer no longer works, everything is tried what it says but still doesn't work"
Faults are reported to client late and dissolved too slowly.
foutmelding 'cannot read property 'contains' of undefined
Does not clear where the error lies. I can't get interactive kpn.

The page does not open all this morning. Is there a malfunction?
Sound and image do not match
I can always find an episode of a scheduled series of recording in the overview of recordings.
"Worthless app. Not KPN worthy and honestly also not used to KPN. I am always very pro KPN, mobile, stuck and TV from KPN, but especially find the TV very moderate to really bad lately."
Also attached.
It is not possible to scroll down in the TV guide so that you can see what is on other channels.
"In the evening and at night I often have problems with logging in, it is then indicated that my login details are changed while that is not the case. Restarting the browser and even restarting the computer does not help. Friendly request to look at here because it is terrible irritating."
Cannot find broadcast missing
Annoying that I can't watch the BBC channels on my laptop. Why is this not possible? My subscription does not apply to all my PCs?
No more fluid image via the PC (TV.kpn.com)
Why is my full screen going on a small screen again after a while?
Why is BBC First and RL Lounche not to look back. Last year at my vacation could it be on my Chromebook.
"Top. I don't know if I was the only one who irritated me to the login greeting, 
 But: welcome! View your profile can only be taken when you are logged in, sounds a lot friendlier"
Why does he always stutter on the Dutch channels with others but not nearly so much ////
good but falter a lot
"bad; Page does not load content, everything has already been tried but just didn't work"
"The preamble: -He, I am very disrespectful and uncivilized to your customers. 
 If I am so addressed in a store, I immediately leave the case."
"App is too unstable and exhibits error messages too often. Unknown error 1002 is regularly shown without any reason. Also in the middle of the looking position at a transmitter that does not allow pressure. When you look a movie and this error message comes in the last disputed, then you are required to see the entire film again. And fear that there is no error message. Log in The app often gives the message that your user data has been changed. After a number of times again, the 'modified' data is accepted although they are no different than the first time you entered them. When you come from, for example, a live broadcast the viewing function and immediately switch to a different function in the Legal mode, you or the error message 1002 or the Leaning function will not be started and you must change the page or fully log in and then again the Start function. These are my greatest irritation points when using the app"
A scroll bar on the right at the 'TV guide' would be handy.
"Program had a break next to the parduff is truncated to start the next broadcast. 
 Can't get it very annoying"
"Recorded programs often linger, so that you have to restart the program. And if you pause for too long, you also have to restart the program. This is very annoying."
Yesterday interactive TV arranged with you on our existing subscription. Today the message 'outdated or incorrect' appears. Very annoying and especially disappointing now that we are already at a campsite!
Why can't German TV channels be received via interactive TV on the 'normal' TV)?
"Not good! 
 I think I'll pay that I can also watch TV on my laptop. 
 Unfortunately I can only watch TV on my phone and not on my laptop. rode? unknown. 
 Now at home on my own WiFi just don't work either. unfortunately."
"In the app on my MacBook, the subtitles do not want. 
 The subtitles often run behind. 
 He also puts it as standard every time I log in again. Is that possible?"
Connection is always gone
"On my computer, I can currently only view NPO 1.2 and 3. The other channels don't work"
"I cannot look back on the recordings made of fiberglass transmitters in the app or via the internet. Very annoying, because now I have to return all non-fiber optic transmitters that had just removed in my favorite channel list."
"Again I will notify you (I received no response to my previous feedback) that KPN TV suddenly no longer works in my Google Chrome browser. Restart, Log in, etc. I have already tried. A solution please. Incidentally, KPN TV works in the Firefox browser. With VR. gr."
Don't address me with Hey !! I find that blood annoying from the Ikea. It's rude .....
"Doesn't work, always Error 6012"
"Online TV is my only way of watching TV (I don't have a TV device anymore). And then the app suddenly appears to have a few annoying limitations. Certain channels can record, but cannot look back online, such as my favorite channel BBC First. Whether a program pausing, but cannot look further afterwards, because it jumps 'live' and then I will lose the rest of the program and it is also not possible to rewind, because that is not allowed. Or have seen a program half, but after a break have to start all over again, including advertising blocks ... terrible!"
Only image no sound ??? Is that can TV
Looking back and pausing Aircrash Investigation at National Geographic is not working properly today
I am not able to view KPNITV TV Guide now since Monday. Learn to view everything is Swart

 I irritate me of the above. I am not a dog, but a paying customer !!!!"
I want the online possibilities on my PC at least as good as those of the Android app. Now I can't 'look back' on my PC. That really needs better !!!!
Pretty annoying that if a program gets stuck you have to look again from the start.
"It would be nice if the icons of the recorded programs are not all the same. If it is the original icon, it is much easier"

"Online is no problem, but via the TV there is the problem that the network fails. Can this be solved?"
What is a feedback ????
what nonsense where stay / answer
Connection comes back very poorly for the umpteenth time !!
"In itself I find the online good. 
  ""Öpnames"" I often look through my phone (hotspot) on my laptop to TV and recordings in places where there is no Wi-Fi. TV is reasonable but the recordings if you want to play it goes off. It is annoying that it must 'draw' regularly. Why can't he load something for example? 
 A TV app for my Samsung 65tu8000 TV would also be desirable."
Very satisfied with this service and possibilities.
That the signal on the laptop is still not good.
Hapert sometimes
works for no meter
"Tricky that you cannot flush a recorded program (on a laptop), while this can be done on my TV."
Really doesn't go well. Could not come in the ITV app with my KPN ID different devices tried Town finally succeeded. Do you throw out the program and I can't look back and what I have just recorded super annoying
Image sometimes falters. But that can be due to poor cabling to our apartment. KPN uses the former 2-wire wire broadcasting threads
Formerly (years ago?) I could look virtually nothing on evenings between 20:00 and 23:00. It wasn't an my internet. Nowadays I can do that! Thank you for that!
"When a program has already ended but it is still included, it is incredibly irritating that you cannot play the same recording as possible as on TV"
Don't charge
I find it annoying if saved programs cannot be viewed via the computer. Then give at least one reason why that cannot.
"Always experience that I cannot log in, once logged in it stands out."
Very clear side
"Very often you can't look certain things. Now, for example, I try to look Gray's Anatomy on the app on my phone: I get black image every time after a few minutes. So I thought I'm trying through the laptop on the site but he doesn't start here either."
good  
The page is fine but in general we often suffer from the hitches (late response times and error codes when loading programs)
"Not always optimal. I just had to log in again and then it turned out that my login details were changed (I had changed nothing). New password created, but could still not log in. After many fives and six people eventually succeeded, although it took a very long time before the programs were loaded."
The site gives an error message that is incorrect. He often starts.
boundary
"Episode runs at the same point, it cannot look further and has to start again, very annoying if you are already at 2/3 of the episode."
Errors look back. And if he does it takes it long before you see what. This is especially lately. Also on ordinary TV Surver can't pick it up.
"It does not work. There is suddenly I don't have a recording in my package, while I have been. What an annoying hassle here."
very bad
I can't view stored items at the moment

Good reception and program works great.
Every time this program stops on Min Laptop RTL4
KPN ITV installed on my MacBook Air - cannot view anything.
Good page. Just a pity that so many (unnecessary) actions are needed to be able to give a program.
nice to watch TV
must
"I have to log in again and again 
 Isn't that anything else."
the menu is horrible
What a stuttering on this transmitter .....
Falter
Now in the picture every day. Little exaggerated. How can I turn off this?
Throw that rot advertising off when looking back!
Previous menu was much clearer. Then I could overlook several channels on 1 screen. Now you have to scroll back and forth to oversee an evening. Terrible annoying.
It would be useful if you can mark multiple recordings in the recording list and then remove it in 1x. Now the caroussel jumps back after every recording.
Fine. I am satisfied.
Not all recorded programs can be viewed on the laptop. Sometimes statue stands still
Crashes too often
"Perfect, on the road on your mobile. watch TV...."
Here and there something unclear
Why can't I watch ESPN
Great in every way
Why does ESPN get to it ...
"Can the overview page on Desktop also enter? 
 Would be nice"
"Often programs no longer want to load in the middle of an episode. If this is a program what I look back (so not recorded) you have to reload it and see again completely from the beginning, because you cannot flush through commercial channels. I think it's fine if it sometimes happened, but it happens very often, so would be nice if something is done about it!"
Good

 All at ESPN"
"Very easy to use, also very good image. You almost no longer need TV"
Is a great simple app
It is very annoying that if you put a pause program that it doesn't work anymore when it is no longer working to look further. Then just that circle always continues to turn and you can no longer see the rest of the program. Balen this!
Too bad recordings can often only be watched via the TV.
"Don't understand why I can see some channels visible on TV, not on my home work / computer spot."
"If I look back and the program is interesting behind it, then you can't look any further. You must then select the following program manually."
"A super app !!!!!! 
 I often look back what back when I am not at home via my cell phone. 
 My husband is surprised that I did that far from home. 
 We often take films. 
 In 1 word super"
Poor service as a transmitter without announcement from the basic package is achieved and therefore the recordings of that channel is no longer available (Strade Bianche Men's Eurosport 2). Is there anything to do about it (without having to purchase the plus package)?
1star to buy that I cannot buy the Loats Tyd
Nothing more to do so works great
"The reception on my Mac Book is to cry, with WiFi Super"
"I was looking back a movie. Came near the end. My wifi then pops out but don't beat my progress. Now I am obliged to look back everything (one and a half hours), which of course I don't go. This is because I can't rinse further."
The films and series continue to hack.
"When looking back that absentive advertising omits 
 takes more than 15 minutes you are not good"
satisfied
Don't do anything about it

Recently I have always been thrown out of a movie that I have recorded. Sometimes I can't watch any film on my laptop anymore.
"I don't understand that I can watch a program on television while it is recorded but that this is not possible on PC, tablet or smartphone."
fine clear site! Use it a lot!

I don't find the TV guide handy

"A knowledge had a relationship with an Asian woman. Stressoog came up and demand came: what do you call us? The answer was: 'Big Nose', and in men's extra, because a large nose was associated with the size of the genitals.

 Can not look at the telfoon or laptop."
Too bad there is no search function for films that were on tv last week

Why can't I see all channels?
"With the app scheduling a recording is very often wrong: it seems if it works, but that does not do it (s). So just with a website if you are not at home."
"wide, current assortment"
"If switching from channel could also be done within the already watching TV channel, it would be completely top."
"Too bad you can't look back for more than a week, if necessary. And irritating that you cannot return to halfway in the app if the recording is not completely over."
Image shocked and slow on the laptop
Sometimes I suddenly lost my favorites
"Why is it still not possible to return recorded programs via the recipient, but not online. See via app or computer?"
Unfortunately problems with looking back must always load.

"Poor image quality with many interruptions, which do long about the recovery ... 
 Just like on the phone, I cannot download an app on my HP laptop with Windows10 operating system or via Chrome."
"Well-arranged, no problems."
Works fine. Simple and clear.
The site regularly runs and then only the image or sound continues. Reloading the page often takes many minutes. The image also fails a lot
"Good platform, unfortunately it always walks a bit on real-time TV."
"Watching the TV with Chrome Cast the app works very badly? Via the app from Zico Top 
 Already called but nothing yet improved"
"Very lobby. Delayed image, lots of cubes"
Customers should get almost money for using KPN ITV. Never worked well and it is usually not working at all. Often the same error message 1001
Search function often does not work well at the Belgian TV and NPO 2 extra programs
Pussy app that always gives captures and an error message.
Great to be able to watch when my wife is sitting at the TV.
"Super annoying that it gets crashes and you can't look anymore from where you stayed! 
 And then nothing can be used as a regular customer, not nice!"
"Why don't you look back all recorded programs on every device, laptop, smartphone, TV etc."

"If I want to watch PSV or other football, I can never see it."
"Strange that, for example, Sporza can only be viewed from the 'home address'. This way I can't stream this on my laptop ..."

"Try to watch football. 
 Lots of still image. Very annoying.

Like more transmers from package also available in app

Too bad the app does not always go through well without having to restart again
fuck off
"I would like to see the guide in a pop-up, so that you can browse nicely while looking at something. 
 Looking back is fantastic, but if you only look back half and then want to look back later, you usually have to start again (but not always!). That is annoying, especially in programs with a lot of advertising."
"If you have deleted a saved recording, the recording does not disappear and the software is fixed. Totally close ITV and restart and you can continue again."
Every time start-up there is give us feedback!

Signal often bad. Takes long with loading. Modem Experia Box V10
"I would like an option to adjust the quality of the stream. Now it often changes from quality that causes hatches. In addition, it would be nice if I can always choose whether I want to start a program from the start or of the current moment. Especially with football matches it is annoying if I turned it up in the 40th minute and then knows the stand while I want to watch from the beginning."
Very bad connection every 15 sec is a buffer stop
Value -cheese. Many channels are only available at home?!?!?

 And below it ""Turn on via MijnKPN."" 
 But how? If I click on that button I get https://mijn.kpn.com/#/overzicht, with the right my invoices and on the left under 'Overview' just gray beams that continue to move and not loaded. 

 Which channel packages contain channels that email yoga? I can't find that on KPN.com too. 

 And what is the tel.no. What you are just helped instead of referring to your site where you were of course looked at? 
 I already feared for the service when Telfort became KPN ..."
The screen remains small and does not adapt to my 3800 recollution and therefore stands in the middle of my three screens that must adjust
Perfect reception but limited wifi only receiving garden and office a lot of noise
Easy to watch TV everywhere.
"I am looking for an option to make channels favorite, often look at online cycling on Sporza (one / canvas) but that is always looking for searching before I have found the channel."
good  
"On the mobile app, the image remains regular when playing recordings. The sound continues, but the image is silent. Can you solve that?"
Find going well as online TV enjoys it
good  
Always Error 1002 What is that ???
first
I am satisfied with KPN. I think it's a shame that you can't look back with some recordings
"Poor overview of channels and names 
 Many Errors 
 Ugly appearance Anno 2021"
The stream is always interrupted despite that there is sufficient network capacity
Looking back is very bad
connection
Is often fixed
slow
Stop this

would be nice if can also look through safari
"If a match on ESPN has not finished yet, the program sometimes suddenly stops. As a result, you miss the injury time of a competition."
"Displays failure 3016 on tablet, nothing works"
"For football matches an option to click on the highlights on the play bar at the bottom to go back to these highlights (goals, serious violation, opportunities, etc.)"
does it well
"It is annoying that if you put M on a break and then suddenly go to another channel. If you go back, you can't rinse M back because then does it does anything."
No more John Woolf
Why somewhere he sometimes stops at it and do not look at it ....
"It keeps hanging again 
 worthless"
Occasionally he gets stuck.
Stop often and fall out regularly
"Why is it true that my children and at all is the possibility, to be confronted with all the gore porno in the erotic section? 
 Both in the app and on TV there is the possibility for this. We find this incredible and is a reason for us to cancel at KPN."
"Hapert's image and that makes looking at a soccer game very annoying, for example"
light image
"Weird that your programs can only look back after half an hour or so, while this is possible with the IPTV receiver and if the program still runs."
I think the guide cannot scroll awkwardly
"Hapert, hits back to the previous program, one time you can look back the other time not. If a program gets stuck you have to look again from the start. Often your PC has to restart, so you have to log in again at other sites."
"Quality change, with Nameterlijken"
is ok
"In itself very good, but a lot of fault (faltering image) for all at football laws, does not know why, possibly old KPN installation ???"
Sometimes a hitch in ESPN. Furthable
"Log in does not work out occasionally. Sometimes it succeeds when I try a few times, sometimes not. Since I have a password manager, it is not a password"
Well you can see if a program is not looking back that can only be done as the next program is already at least 10 minutes and that is really annoying Mis JR the first 10 minutes but you have to wait first until the following program Busy real bales !!!
Stating image and bad sound
Many Haperingen lately via KPN ITV lately
"When a recording is scheduled, from the TV guide, the guide always goes back to the beginning of the day, very annoying, and you have to go all the way back to the right time, annoying bug!"
Streaming ESPN is super badly hacking.
Very badly falls away regularly
top
Quick asking for feedback. It has already done this for 3 days. Sounds enough. starts to become annoying
top
"In itself it is nice and convenient to look back programs, but some incredible disturbing that a) you can't pause in between, because if you do that too long you have to view the entire program (b) the program regularly because of a malfunction or If you stop and then you also have to look again. You cannot prove to the place where the program had stopped. It is so really a big progress if that could."
poor connection
Easier can find my favorite channels.
Too bad the TV runs for 10 seconds on online
boundary
The channels of Ziggo (extra package) are played on my laptop.
"If I look a program and a break (superfine function) and then want to look further, but now another program has already started in the background, I can no longer look at the paused program. Frustrating!"
Connection often means that the competition runs a few seconds
"bad very often a day, the crochet remains all programs"
Good so far.
"I can't scroll with my mouse pad, I would like it. The ability to choose another layout would be a nice option, such as those on mobile. It would also be nice to be able to do page up and page down as on the TV."
0 stars worthless
Hapert too much
Not everything can be seen?
The nets work well alone Ziggo Sport is a drama
no
"Great, but very moderate that you can't flush when looking back. Internet falls away and then has to view it all the way again ..."
Runs very often. At first I thought this was on my WiFi but then also tried to 4G and the image remained still. And if many people want to look at the app as during the classic (Ajax-PSV) the entire website / app stops with it.
"Ensure optimum operation of ITV, whereby no hitches arise when switching to another channel or that a channel such as CNN does not function properly"
Start Stop button stays in the middle of the picture
I would like to embed this site
Too bad that not all Hindi channels are present in the online TV watch from KPN. I would like that if it is there.
Why can't I look back on my cream book much
Would like to see guide by channel
top
"It is easy. But KPN becomes less, can no longer look cycling on the Belgian. Has went to a transmitter what KPN does not broadcage. F1 has stopped on the German channel. Ziggo therefore becomes an increasing option, you can watch this one"
buffering buffering buffering
Current connection is really nothing .... remain on hold mode
Two things: (1) I am very happy with the app: through a web browser on my laptop the top works! And (2) on my mobile (a Samsung of 2 years old) the app works properly: I am 80% of time looking at the green round spinnery. Hopefully you can do something with that.
Must often log in while I am familiar
"The synchronization between mobile, TV, and laptop never does it. Continue where you have stayed 8 out of 10 times. Sometimes a recording is not possible while this can be done on TV again."
Too bad the timelines don't always hit
"I am disappointed that I switched from Ziggo to KPN because I can no longer receive my favorite German channels on my PC at KPN. And I think that's really sad! If I had known before, I would never have switched to you!"

Totally great!
"very bad connection 
 cannot optimally watch films and programs,"
"Little variable free movies, would be nice if there are more free movies"
easy everywhere
"Much good, but the layout of video country is really bad."
Before
Excellent display and clear use.
"Look at Time to Kill after + _ 3/4 of the film 
 I continued to the next film? how so? 
 We have ... v.d a 3.PULY subscription for years I think this is very unpleasant / unsatisfactory watching TV in this way. It's not the first time. 
 Is this because I break through in between? 
 is this not stood? 

 Please a serious answer to this question."
"Despite the horrible torture theme, the sublime is beautiful music, and there are whole pieces that are generally human themes ... Wir Setzen UNS in Tränen Nieder ---- Vijstote"
It is not possible to scroll down.
"The WebPlayer is often fixed, or reduces the player of quality, despite the fact that I do not change place. It is also quite annoying that a black screen comes a short time when you are watching live TV and switches to the TV guide between two programs"
He fals when I watch TV on my laptop
The sound runs but the image is silent.
sharp image
"Fantastic. Clear image and sound. 
 Image and sound super. 
 A luxury ... during my computer work in the background my news programs follow"
"Looking back program cannot. Always gets away, please response to this"
"There is always something wrong with online TV. One time the image and sound do not run synchronously, the other time the film stops every 30 sec and you have to open the page again. Very unfortunate because your favorite TV program cannot be viewed like this."
"System does not work properly on a laptop! I can not play SBS9 and BBC First after recording on my laptop, not really nice."
first
Image in the picture is super on the laptop
Occasionally goes away
"Why can't you turn off the Dutch-speaking Caption subtitles by default? Annoying that when you look at a NL-transmitter, you have to put it out every time."
"Terrible bad connection and have KPN as a provider. 
 Get GSM increasingly reading it is unfortunately not possible these programs cannot be viewed exterior EU, I live in the Netherlands 
 In addition, the Progamma.s constant, sound always falls away!"
Very faltering image
"With removal of a recording on the screen, ITV hits and you can no longer return to the saved recordings, without first renewing the page. That has been that I stand out since last week."
Why can't you easily exchange channel button Next channel button Back Now this is via the TV guide or via now on TV
"When looking back programs, there is no subtitles. Also not with recorded programs. 
 That is very unfortunate because I am heard. Then I often look at NPO. They do have subtitles at missed broadcasts."
"All.es neat in clear reviews! 
 And good programs"
"Product usually functions, but not always. Furthermore, things regularly go wrong:
- Despite the fact that I am open to the tab, I must regularly log in again
- This is often not clear and the page then provides error messages that the page or program cannot be started (without reason). I have found out that I have to change the page after which I have to log in
- What is really very annoying and a show stopper: a TV program regularly starts 'spontaneously' the next day when I use the computer again. The Mac that I use is on day and night and is used as a general computer by the family. Out of the Blue then goes suddenly (even though I am in another program) a program that I have stopped the previous day and you are frightenful to you
- Image quality is not constant and often changes during a session. With Netflix or prime this never happens, so should be can be solved. I have often had it that I had to watch the journal through NPO because ITVonline makes a jar of it"
"Don't ask for feedback, and if you already do it, don't be such a striking and disturbing message"
I can't see all channels from my TV package via interactive TV. I think this is strange / a shame
"Beautiful version, everything is in balance, but the drama is good to express. It is clear that a singer conducts. Everything is intelligible and just (well, unfortunately that is often not just sung. 
 The Sweelinck-Intermezzo: find 
 The continuo beautiful with the babbling Theorbe. 
 All soloists from the highest level. 

 Very well recorded and broadcast, 
 thank you!"
works beautiful
Why is there still a picture of The BFG from December 14 and the mention that I can't look back (logical)
The connection from KPN ITV is very common while all other program streams run spotless.
"Normally works fine. Unfortunately with very popular programs, the system often falls out. Perhaps the capacity still expand something further."
It's okay
"Totally tracted out there by is on-line looking extraordinary user unfriendly. 
 Recorded films are often already demolished before the end, notification that the PW would have changed. After completing manually it works again."
More than regularly the image stops and a green round runs as if he can't keep it up and buffer
Sound Match Image Not
I would give a minus 10. It is a worthless product where no energy has been inserted by KPN. KPN unworthy! †
Can just look nice on the laptop as my spouse wants to see something else
"In general it is good but between two programs it can just go through, now there is a 'cut'."
first
Unfortunately very often! Regardless of the internet.
"I can never play programs live, and already played from the start. Not even when I'm up to t. Shame."
ok.
Nice application. Must always choose lower resolution because otherwise the image fails. In itself this is not such a problem if I have to set the resolution with every channel I choose again insteads so that I don't have to do this every time again.
"Online TV on the computer and TV was always super but since you have made adjustments this has deteriorated. 
 With programs that you look back and that then halfway crachen you can no longer resume, but you have to look at everything again very annoying from the start. 
 This happens too often at the moment. 
 Now sometimes to have viewed 3 quarters of the program, he stops it once and he starts again from the front and not where I left. 
 Very unfortunate and annoying. 
 Like a response. 

 Kind regards Astrid"
"I think a lot can be faster. 
 The image can also go through a little better. 
 And no longer faltering and stuttering. M VR G."
"Top, just a pity that you can't watch all channels online"
"Great, well-arranged, user-friendly"
"Favourites are not saved permanently. I must redo my favourites each time I log in. Hassle.
When I want to watch a channel I have to click 3 times instead of the channel page opening on the first click. I cannot fast forward through previously aired shows. I regret giving up Ziggo."
Find the page unclear. Many things are out of picture. The app on the iPhone is much better furnished.
"Sound is often poor via XS4ALL, if we switch to NPostart is that good"
"Full screen does not work entirely for me, black sides and bottom. With search, I can see with previous search acts, I do with mouse, but then I always need the keyboard for the Enter key. Clicking the mouse will be easier."
"Watching TV with a speed of 250Mbps does not work, it will connect quickly on the app."
No commercial channels can look back on my laptop (ITV)
Is there no app for Windows?
"Since some time, ITV image and sound have been hitting about all channels .wel on TLC and Discovery 
 Can be done about this 
 MVG Peter"
first
"Not everything can be looked back. That's a shame. 
 Moreover, not all channels can be viewed on your laptop (German channels for example) a pity ..."
must always buffer
"Less login hassle, and not having to click 3 times something to watch"
Works excellent but on the iPad less on the PC.
I still do not understand that when recording programs it is set by default that these recordings are removed with enough space. Is it a lot more convenient to save the recordings and that the recording space (almost) is indicated?
"Very slow! It is that I want to watch my iMac TV occasionally ... but every time it takes a long time before I see a TV image ... and very often the image is hanging .... I'm certainly not satisfied, unfortunately. ... (No problems with other sites on the internet)."
Uncluttered
Can't watch TV
"Screen remains 'Hanging' after removing recorded program via KPN ITV 
 Why adjust the removal of 1 recording after opening this recording This choice directly via Pulldown menu of the relevant recording or is the text (delete serial recording) error"
Get stupid feedback the screen; terribly annoying
"Much too much advertising, via website you can flush and in the app it is much crazier where this is not possible. I no longer look through the app."
"Why can't I watch Films from SBS9 on the computer, which could be at Telfort.This I would consider going to another Provijder."
"It is incredibly disturbing that broadcasts that I have already seen cannot flush upon look back. Terukijken regularly fails through connection problems and then you can start from the front. For example, looking up from Corona news that is very annoying."
"Little weird that you can only view recorded programs on the TV receiver and not on tab, laptop or mobile. Very unfortunate, minus point unfortunately"
"Works well, always your channels and recordings with you."
"If playback lingers and you start the movie again, it goes all the way back to the beginning i.p.v. War you stayed when he stuck. In combination with the fact that you cannot flush ahead is superiritoring"
Does not work with Safari version 13.1.2
"Mediocre. 
 Poor reception. 
 Often often falls / lingers. 
 Restart"
Just what you paid for !!
"Clear appeal. App runs regularly and you can't watch all your recordings through the app, I think that's the biggest downside."
I find it annoying that some channels that I have included are not looking back.
"It can be useful that as soon as you click on a program this will start immediately. Now you have to click again (looking at 'watch'). That is very cumbersome. 

 For XS4ALL we had Ziggo and that had that very nice: programs already started in the program overview itself, so before you clicked on it. Was very pleasant. Get that step out and it saves a lot extra clicked. 

 Furthermore fine."
"If he does not regularly do it, he will continue to load. With looking back, he sometimes stops halfway and you can start again. It is a shame that Telfort has stopped. This is not fun anymore."
Before.
"But two stars, a fat insufficient. I am regularly a few days off home and then watch TV on my laptop. What an incredibly disturbed me is that, for example, I cannot look back on my laptop (saved ...) from SBS9, I can do this on the ordinary TV receiver. It is also incredibly difficult that you have to choose in the guide a day and cannot just scroll further to the left to the previous day (s). Yesterday I could not pause a program on the ordinary receiver, let alone rinse a bit. These 2 things disturb me. And certainly the first. 
 I would like to receive a response to this feedback from me. And that is not optional, but would testify to good customer service."

Website is always stuck
"Half of the time error messages and subtitles are automatic to Dutch channels. For deaf and hard of hearing .... This is extremely disturbing. You can turn it off, but after a few seconds, the CC switches on again."
stopping picture
clear and clear
"Some channels have a block on further rinsing (which is why I record programs). 
 That means that if you have stopped, you have to watch the program again from the front. That means that I just skip channels. I find painful because I miss programs because it is the 'wrong channel'. 
 In addition, when I record channels, I watch through the entire list of films, but when I have chosen a movie, it is difficult for me to jump back and sometimes I get back to the main menu. It would be nice if the history was preserved where I was before. 
 If bandwidth use is not an issue for you, I have more suggestions that make watching more fun through your portal."
"If I log in to work, I am not allowed to look back on certain channels, or what I have recorded not watching. I look at my own paid subscription, and I think that's best uhm, annoying."
"just good. 
 Make it a lot of use."

Until recently I didn't have to log in and recently changed. It will be necessary for some reason but it is irritating.
Nice busy web team !! Nice implementation @Sjoerd :)
"I see no image. 2-4-2021 9:08 Spike, program Top Gear"
"hi, web-mopinion"
Screen is no longer full screen as earlier. So it has become worse
"When a program ends according to the guide, the image stops for a moment, and then continues, so you just miss the last joke/clou/outcome of a program. And you can no longer rewind. Very frustrating! This was never the case, the programs' just walked on one after the other."
"Log in every time and again. 
 Also via Netflix TV"
"Often malfunction, many programs do not work. Slow and harassed search."
"good, well-arranged"
"Works excellent, well -arranged"
no
Problem lately. I look up and want to remove after watching. Recording is removed but I cannot return to the home screen.
Do they think of the evening clock ha ha
"It would be nice if the advertisements could be less loud. Tap less. Sometimes you have to put a film or series a little harder to hear it well. You are shocked, when the advertisement suddenly shouts out your speakers."
Let me move forward. FOK Die KK Advertising Kill I Pay Al KK Abbokosten Let Me Skip that KK Advertising
Loading is increasingly being fixed
"Great, unfortunately not all channels !!!"
no
"Unfortunately live TV regularly attached, without clear reason ... 
 Other streaming services such as Netflix, video country, YouTube remain just working at the same time, so it seems to be not a network issue. 
 Very unfortunate if you are in the middle of a movie or series."
"Since a few months we can no longer look at your programs on our PC. Whether the circle continues to run, so search for the program or the program is constantly standing still and continues to wait again. 
 Since Nov. 2019 we have internet via the fiber optic and it has been working more than 1 year, but in recent months, hopeless."
"Handy because you can also watch TV at other locations, eg vacation."
"Nicely arranged TV guide and easy to choose what you want to see if it is now on the PC, mobile or TV. Easy to record programs."
Video stops every 10 seconds
go once
"ESPN does not work, iMac / MacBook"
Runs way too often
fascinating
Interruption if one program has ended and start next program.
Far too often interruptions during watching TV
Pussy company
Good !
no image!
I don't want to give this open feedback every time I have to give this open feedback. 1 x seems enough to me.
first
"I would not only see in the guide you can record while you watch a program, not only what there is on TV but also what's going on TV on all other channels."
"Watching the TV I would like to have the opportunity to open an overview with what is all about the other channels. This, while my current program simply has been spotted."
Continuous hanging. pity..
Why can't you look back stored recordings at a different location. Weekend away and you cannot even look back on the internet stored recordings. Very bad this
"I like to watch TV on the laptop, but there are some more channels on such as sport and German Zeders but fine"
Why is the NOS Journaal from 8 p.m. and cannot be looked back and not available?
Nice for watching tv on the toilet
"Slow, often malfunction, gets stuck, is not doing with casting to Google devices."
"I miss Ard, ZDF and WDR here. Switching between the channels should be able to be a little faster"
"I try to look back a program. The notification is: You can't look back on this program. I click on the i for info, but the I is not active. Don't see anymore"
Well I can't look back with the noobes so 1 star
At the guide I cannot scroll down. So to RTL7 I can view the guide and not at Veronica or further channels
often work fine
"Usually very good, sometimes an unexpected hitch despite wired internet connection."
"uncluttered. 

 It is just a shame that the channels are always falling away 
 Except Ned 1.23n 3. On my laptop. 
 And the crazy is Netflix does it. 
 Any idea how that is possible."
"I think the menu in principle is very good and understandable. There are only two dots that could use improvement. Firstly, I believe that I cannot always see planned recordings in the guide menu. I must always go to the planned menu menu to see that I do have scooped recordings. 
 Secondly, I will be annoying that you can only use the sound tests when shooting recordings with subtitles. To rinse, for example, you must turn off in the subtitle and then turn on again. Turning off is completely annoying because you have no indication or or off the subtitles."
I'm really happy with it
I don't have any opinions about it's lot easier I find personally .Palmen
"Unfortunately no look look back on the laptop from a few recorded TV recordings, only via TV. 
 Why is this? 
 Isn't logical if you don't have a TV on the road."
works great and very easy
entirely right
TOP
If you look slightly remains that break thing in the screen is very irritating
Fine site only it could be more stable at great things. Then he sometimes shoots too short.
"Thank you for having NL TV everywhere now. 
 Sometimes the website cannot be reached"
Keep it up
I just switched from Ziggo to KPN but miss the small screen when minimizing.
"Since NW updates have been logging in every day, faltering a lot. Like to develop and keep it easy."
Switch faster between channels.
"There is a lot of interruption in the spoken texts, because of this bad to follow,"
Too bad some channels can only be taken from home and this also for included programs
Also displayed broadcasts in list form.
"OK. I have a picture again on my p.c. 
 Thanks."
Moderate interface. Nice to zapping is very difficult. Irritant that programs that are just past are not reflected while that can be done with the XS4ALL Box
Handy for on the road and at the campsite
Stop the questions of pin codes. In all cases.
"Great composition, so no negative comment"
"If you look back program, that the series does not stop just before the end, but just through running"
good  
"If a lot has been looked at a competition of Orange, I can no longer log in to this site! 
 That is very hereditary at such a moment."
Before.
What I'm enormous is the opportunity to view the German channels via the app. Why can't that with KPN and at Ziggo.
Perfect system
"Common images often, never had it before"
"Ensure that if you open the guide to the computer, this is not standard at channel 77. 
 Channel 1 would be more convenient."
Many hitches if you rewind.
Works well.
Beautiful image quality

"Looks good and works practically. 
 Only I think it's a shame that you keep up all the way up in the menu of 'now on TV'. I would find it more pleasant when coming back to the place where you started."
The faltering of live TV if the next programming has gone is extremely disturbing! And Refresh is awkward and not always the solution against faltering ... Mi still a lot of work to be done
Continuous problems with the connections. Always hassle ..
"Generally good. Only like last night I get no TV on my MacBook and or iPad. And this malfunction was not a moment, but has taken the whole evening."
Watching TV via the Google Chrome browser suddenly no longer works. Via Firefox.
"For a laptop is not all you can see what you have recorded that is only on TV, see the logic here. 
 Why not see everything you have included."
Moderate functionality from personal vision.
"dissatisfied with this page that appears every time. Further dissatisfied with the performance (s) of the app on a Windows 10 64-bit environment. 
 When I choose automatically choose ""audibly the sound"" every minute or something. When I then set the resolution at 720p, it seems to be right."
Top
fine and clear
Stop the images continue after a long wait and stop after a few minutes. Or does not start anymore and must restart the site
Why not F1
"Feedback? Sounds English, and who is us?"
Great ITV from KPN Everything is clear to see and heard
"Unfortunately no German channels online. Many here needs. Indiase and Arabian, may hear because for that people have programs in their own language. French channel? How many Frenchs live here? Germany has the largest border with the Netherlands and is economically of great importance to our country so it is wise to offer those channels Ard / ZDF."
"Every time I have planned a recording, the guide will jump back to 00: 00h. After a trip to 'saved', the guide will return to the last used time. Very annoying!"
Recording is not always good
Very happy that this service is there.
"If that happens, and if that happens then you have to start from the beginning, which is very annoying at channels where you cannot continue."
Great site and nice and fast.
ITV app is very unstable. The app is regularly looked at or a restart is required. Often reinstallation of the app is also required.
Why does the TV guide jumping on the hour 00.00 after you have a program recording the understood and goes back to TV guide
"Get many notifications that an error has occurred (1002) X. 
 Then press further to look and he continues. 
 Doesn't matter what server you look. 
 Quite irritating."
How many complaints ???
"Since the Van Telfort went to KPN nothing but misery, eg no connection, malfunction of reports etc., I am not happy and consider it to switch"
"Seriously bad that channels that are accessible via regular TV are not available via I-TV. As a result, the package is seriously reduced and therefore a lot less interesting."
Nice and easy to watch at work.
Good but the last three-four weeks remain stored films regularly or cannot be started
"More often than that a broadcast continues to run completely. Must often start new to be able to look further and I don't do anything else on the internet. 
 I use Firefox and no no other should be tested, I just think I work. Just watching TV on the PC works fine so what is the problem that I can look back so hard."
"This morning it was impossible to use ITV. 
 The same applied earlier tonight. 
 Now just after midnight I can use ITV again .... I use ITV daily, usually satisfaction."
"Hello, after a program, I can't look at the next program. Then the laptop stops broadcasting. Is it possible to view longer than 1 program? Thank you in advance."
Dear ever!
The last 2 days I get the homepage and follow-up pages very difficult on my screen. I am waiting idiot long.
"Works better and better, often a long wait after opening the page"
Stream stop halfway through the film. Page Refresh means that the film must be viewed again from the start (Veronica). By rinsing to where I am not allowed? I have to go back to work tomorrow. Let that film sit. Better watch films on other platforms
What is sometimes worthless to open. And that for KPN ..... it regularly takes an eternity or nothing happened at all and stare at that green round. Or 'contact' but cannot open the channels. That is not possible for a TV provider ......
"Effe see what more is, while the 'large' TV is on. Quality is good enough, not looking football for a little longer. (too few figurines per second?)"
Dramatic Performance at the moment
"Good but that reminastant hooks,"
Your browser app always gets stuck sometime
Disappointed that if you don't have a TV and only a laptop to see I cannot record and look back with the programs of my favorite TV channel BBC First. Pay for it for this.
"Looking back from some programs not possible, while it is allowed on the TV. For example CNN."
Hapert. Only not to ads
The app does not work on Android 9
"I got the tip, because the site does not want to start, to remove the cookies. I did that but now I can't log in to Edge anymore. I give up my username and password and then nothing happens. No report or whatever. Where is KPN's good service?"
"Always faltering image, while internet connection is fine"
Unfortunately. I would have liked to be seen.
The Feed often has a delay.
"March 31 in the evening, very slow, do not load programs or hardly any, a lot of errors etc."
"What a pussy app .. works 9/10 times. Usually no image, faltering sound or every load. This is not how it should be."
"I use the online TV watch regularly and to all satisfaction. 
 What I miss in the online version but also at the television cabinet is the possibility to merge the stored programs in 1 folder. Or the function to create your own folders so that you can save per category."
"Recordings are often bad to look. Hitch while looking, or start very slowly / not."
"Currently it doesn't work all my internet, it does it again. 
 t is slower naja say slowly."
"Rarely look back undisturbed; The system usually blocks or there is always short stops, or hitch in sound. The KPN service is extremely frustrating in understanding, solutions and the end of WiFi disruptions! I will soon be relocating: KPN really goes first!"
"Slow. Even with 100 MB / s on fiberglass you regularly get a rotating green circle while you are in the middle of a program. 
 And since today 'freezes' the site when you go back to 'now on TV' at Chrome."
Can't scroll through TV guide. Only the channels 1 to 6 visible
Every time you have something to look at something that starts to be very annoying through an unexpected error now
Works for no meter
"it is falling over, falling over"
"All channels run smoothly, except the Ziggo total channels, if I want to watch a football match, the broadcast everything except smoothly. how is this possible? This is only on my laptop. not on my phone"
"There are too many steps to play a program. I also think it's all very unstable, often a program stops after the advertising gave the advertising and e.d."
"Great page, I like to use it but why is the page not loaded right now ??? Whatever browser I use (Chrome, Edge), I look n you go to a nice black screen. I now see a text with sorry in the background and that I have to close and log out ..... ????"
The page is regularly offline and this applies to the stored programs. This is quite annoying.
KPN TV doesn't work.
He lingers
"Not everything has only been renewed here, even MN PC."
"Does not work properly for a few days. Start poorly. Runs fast (TV.kpn.com via laptop, stable internet connection)"
The white text on the yellow bar at the top has very little contrast.
Broadcasts that 'NET' (up to 30 minutes) or so have not been viewed. That is very annoying if I am just too late.
App on LG TV loop last 2 weeks continuously. Is a high dwelling TV with good fixed internet connection
Crashes
Hang your own on a bomb on KPN The Hague
"Not all channels are available and therefore not the recording of fuctions either. 
 Slow and bad connection regularly."
000
Very bad. The connection is gone every time
Video often fails
Can always look at something as well as the TV.
I can't always log in
"I think this is ideal for my laptop. 

 Allen I regularly have a malfunction with TV as tonight 31-3 stands for 10-15 min and then image falls away and then keeps searching for connection."
Site is often slow and the stream falter regularly.
"Can difficult log in, no TV on p.c. 
 Gives no error code !!!"
Too much advertising
Crashes
It all functions excellent
It usually works well. A program that has just been finished back online does not work. That is only possible after a longer period of time.
"Many problems at Microsoft Edge, many trollers. Use ITV a lot on a laptop and mobile online"
"Otherwise I am pretty satisfied, but today it is slow. WiFi has just been tested quickly enough"
Too bad you cannot see all channels at home on the WiFi.
good  
Well-arranged !!!!
"I have an extensive package with O.A. German channels. However, I cannot stream this, as well as a number of other channels. What is the cause / reason here?"
Not to receive now
I regularly have problems with the broadcast on my laptop. Remains endless search. The lot also stagnates during a broadcast. Then I have to wait until the whole will turn again. So I really don't like it optimal.
very slow
what a cunt experience
"Very bad, you are looking at the recurrence of the news, stops it with the report 'forward for this channel not permitted'. This happens regularly"
"KPN ITV does not work on a laptop and tablet. 
 We cannot see our data from KPN more. Nowhere to find a telephone number to contact us."
"I would like to be able to zap, so from transmitter 1 to 2 and back"
Functions perfectly!
The Hapert program often
too much buffering
A soccer match is not normal to follow. Picture is always silent. Within half an hour 4 to 5 minutes behind
Handy navigating between the different channels. Subtitles is also an advantage.
"Since I log in to KPN, my channel has fallen away, I am very dissatisfied !!!"
"I currently experience a lot of discomfort to watch the online TV. To get bad connection,"
Very slow. recorded starts even slower than the rest
get nothing to see
"When using Firefox, site does not work properly: images of sticks and do not run synchronously with sound. Refreshen from Firefox does not matter."
poor connection
good facility
Before
"Does not function stable, often falls away when your programs look back or rinses back"
worthless
Image and sound Hapert
"I am generally satisfied with your product. Two things that I want to feed back because they are less / go:

1) Overview evening programming in the KPN ITV app
(I use an iPhone): I am an old Ziggo customer. Overall I am very satisfied with your app. But I find the overview of the evening programming part 'TV guide' is a lot less clear. In this app you must always slide back and forth to earlier / later in the evening, to see what comes after the current program. At Ziggo a very large part of the evening was visible at once. I experienced that as a lot more convenient. And this has a larger ease of use.

2. If you want to restart a live program in the app from the beginning, it regularly occurs that halfway through or on far before the end the program is suddenly terminated. Perhaps this has to do with that the live program has ended. However, if you started later, this is really irritating. Especially if it is a program that cannot be flushed when you start again ....

Hopefully you will have something to this feed. If there is a solution that I don't know, I would of course also like to hear that!

Greeting nick"
Doesn't do it again. will be too busy in the region. usually in the evening
Ridiculous that I still can't look back all stored programs
Terribly poor range today March 31
very often malfunction
If he keeps doing good now Haper He every time I are via abo song I hope I hope it goes better
"Far too slow, everyone walks."
Works perfectly from Spain
"Recordings are often fixed. In addition, my account synchronizes on the laptop and the TV. This means that I cannot look directly at a program."
"Works great from the browser, would like an app in the Microsoft Store"
Why can't I look back on my laptop.
"If it works, it works, but often failure with TV guide and recordings; And stutters when I have been working on computer."
I have to log in to my iPad again since two days. Why?
"Sound quality KPNITV via a laptop is moderate / bad. 
 Sound lingers / stop / falter / lot of noise / bibbert. 
 Upon use of streaming services, etc. No problem with sound reproduction. 
 A solution please."
Unfortunately no connection regularly
Bad
"This page charged a computer, noticeable and measurable, very heavy. Certainly compared to Netflix, prime or Disney via the computer. 

 With multiple programs, the page looks through each other is fasting. This can then be remedied by closing the browser and log in again at TV.kpn. 
 This is independent of the browser (Google, Firefox) and computer. Asus Zenbook with I7 and Lenovo with i5. 

 Functionality also does not seem constant. 
 The one moment is remembered until you looked at. The other moment starts with the program further look again."
"I am happy with it, would like to continue live and not as sometimes halfway through the successive program. Dan TV guide in the pulldown menu yesterday, Eggster instead of tomorrow ..."
"In general it goes well but sometimes there are some still fragments. Furthermore, it seems to cost some time to return to the previous choice menu after terminating a saved item."
very well
Slowly....
great image
Unstable. Regularly temporarily not functional. Could be better.
"After every change / update, TV is not live because it sometimes crashes or because there is a delay"
good  
I have a problem with KPN watch TV
"worthless, it no longer works,"
Could be slightly quicker to switch. But all in all it works great.
"The page regularly stuck, inevitable!"
The Android app is really worthless .... that falter is always ... should often load ..... would be nice if it could buffer something
Site works great
Very unclear to see what is on TV by channel
"Sorry... 
 Something went wrong. Refresh the page by clicking on this button and try again. 

 Tips for if the problem persists: 
 Close the tab and open the page in a new tab 
 Log out and again 
 Remove all cookies for tv.kpn.com"
Volks the day
perfect
"The same as yesterday and the day before yesterday and etc. Today, after 7 times a button, a blue button suddenly came and he reported that logging did not work, press again and again and again, after 10 times I gave up. Logging did not work, maybe make a new design for this site ???"
do not
Like good support for Safari. Start subtitles (Dutch) unsolicited and when you turn them out (must be every time) then he will automatically turn on by program OveGANG
It works badly
Great on the computer
Bad stream
picture often stands still or no connection
"Series scheduled by me are sometimes not classified as such in the guide and must then be included by also checking the 'ordinary' plan recording. 
 Website KPN ITV is not always available and then remains 'tolling'. 
 Regularly 'problems in the network' is shown on the TV receiver if I try to call up a recording."
"I can't watch sports without hitches, I am clearly not satisfied"
Bad stream
Continue like this and improve a little better
so slow
Why can't I see opames on a laptop
"The menu is now very slow, and does not open at all."
Just good
Problems with slow connection
Hard to understand why not all stored programs cannot be seen online. Here I paid for the package.
An unexpected error has occurred. Please try again later. (Cannot Read Property 'Containers' or undefined)
"The site works less and less well, something with 'containers cannot be loaded' or something like that .. 
 Or sorry there is something wrong ...."
"Doesn't go that way anymore. Streaming often buffers or stops completely. The site is not available today regardless of the browser. Netflix, Disney, Prime, German TV stream, go well, but XS4ALL TV is much slower. Even when I am on other WiFi as in hotels, for example."
"Great page, loads fast and clear image / sound. Occasionally the image fails, that can be lying on my computer (AMD processor, 8 MB DDR, Windows 7)"
"Very difficult to 'look back' from a few days ago. Previously there was a choice for the day or date, but unfortunately that is no more"
"Slow and pages do not come: https://tv.kpn.com/details/program/875241253 
 Sorry etc."
"Uncluttered. I mainly use TV guide N1-3 and canvas (to see if I want to take something in the evening). Films on TV (for the same reason). 
 Saved to look into the break. Too bad I can't look at Canvas programs from iPad or laptop."
"Bad working, few options, browser limitation"
needs a long time to load
Too bad German channels cannot be received.
"Terribly bad, as already indicated by a telephone conversation with KPN. As the so-called last year update, I get the Error Code 1002 time and time again and so, I can't look no more normal on my PC with Google Chrome browser."
"Not everything can be looked back on the PC. 
 And if you can look, the program often strikes!"
Good image and sound.
Before
Too bad there are not the same possibilities than on a KPN cabinet and TV. Looking back and recording.
"The website works fairly well, but clearly has some fiber points: 
 - Record button while the broadcast plays 
 - In anyway, navigation to other channels while the broadcast plays 
 - The door scroll time bar at the TV guide is very unclear. Rather per channel a list with start / stop times 
 - Possibility to make your own selection and order of channels."
"Can you keep the stored favorites in Sync between Web App and Mobiel App, Thankies"
In browsers not always so fast. Remains often in all browsers except Safari.
Often lingers when starting up. Programs gradually cut down. Slow streaming transmissions.
"I miss the return option online on my PC that I recently had. I would think it would be normal if I can also watch the same channels that I can watch on my TV for a week, I can also look back online. That was the case at first."
It often doesn't work. Especially early in the morning.
"Works well, after a few points. Comedy Central TV guide does not correctly correct. And logging in via user name is not always possible, then you must log in with your subscription number and that is hassle!"
"If you look a recording, it pauses (via latop) and after + - 10 minutes want to look further, the page will remain loading and you have to start and restart and search where you have stayed with watch. Furth, well-arranged. easy to use"
"Navigating the TV guide works very badly. 
 logical and usual there are the scroll bars 
 But here is not with PGDN and / or PGUP happened after a delay doesn't work well"
first
It would be nice if the channel choices are kept in the cloud so that I do not have to set my favorite channels (for example) per device.
Malfunction and more malfunction and much more malfunction
"Easy, fast and well-arranged. Both online physically home has watched TV and fully received a new dimension. Do not adjust the agenda to the offer, but adjust the offer to the agenda. 
 In our family we have several preferences, which we can now fulfill everyone in our own way and time. #Heelgblijmee"
Watch online TV on my laptop for the first time online. Super!!!
Now I always have to log in first this just stood this find this really annoying
Slow and don't do it regularly !!
"Just leave the app too. Many disturbances or slow. For more than 2 hours no good connection has had other providers, it works a lot better and faster. And when you look or there are malfunctions, then there is never going on.
Recently also with the fixed house connection. No fault available. 4 days had no internet, so also unable to work (office at home). Later it turned out to be cable break. Due to a hotel, everything went faster. With us they would only come and watch a few days later and would therefore be without internet any longer. Very bad. With my first fault message I pointed out the KPN that it was likely to have a cable break, excavation work nearby. But, just stop the list, reset modem ect, new modem (no effect), inner promoter, outer engineer ect.
Just stick to protocols. It is that switching no option has been seen. But otherwise we would switch to Ziggo, cable is present and then also have the internet. Now still a copper wire of the KPN with upload from 5 and download 25 MBBs not exactly quickly. And at 15m from our house there is KPN fiberglass. †"
"Runs great, fast and beautiful image quality"
Just a pity than Videoland is not included
Henze is a cool guy !!!
"Good design, menu ok, but why couldn't I find usage instructions? Scrolling through day, menu etc has unnecessarily delivered irritations"
"If you delete the last episode of a serial recording, you cannot continue."
Can also view channels outdoors
unstable
Why are SBS 9 or BRT 1 recordings to look into the app?
Slow and always sticks.
Work in general.
just good
"Last time often mention that he suddenly lingers and no further charge, after Refresh, he will continue."
bad since the big update in January; unreliable; I have already called twice before and there is nothing to see it; You can reach me on the e.mail address or tel. 0356210132
Keep turning very shame have more MB a pity
Just nothing can look worthless
Very dissatisfied. App often does badly ..
. Get some more channels?
"Poor, recordings and streams just jerk, do something about it !!"
"Website technically severely undermated .... slow, carelessly with oiping."
"When I watch TV on my laptop, the connection is very often very bad, constantly loading. My router is right next to me and it all happens at KPN ITV online, never on YouTube,"
"I looked the program, put the recording on a break then wants to play it again and everything then stands still. Now I want to go back to where I had gone, but that is not possible that is apparently not allowed. Annoying I don't want to look at the same piece twice. After all, I also think it is also possible to pay for recordings. This often happens very annoyingly ..."
Around midnight the TV guide will be a mess and get barrels confused on the PC ... Totally lost it ...!
I would like to see all the channels I recorded
"A nice page, but the stored programs are not clear"
Hoppeneless receipt of both direct broadcast and films; Constant jerky image that runs far behind! Always further behind! Even this mail cannot be sent!
first
very well
"I think the scrolling, I was more satisfied with the old version of the page."
a good one
boring films and series and often runs
Ned 1.2 and 3 do not hesitate very annoying and the commercial channels. How did that happen ?
"Make more intuitive, fewer clicks 
 Last viewed channels on the main page 
 Immediately click to the channel (image) instead of information with watch / record (can also be a temporary window over the image"
first
"If Foreign (German) channels, do not get available online."
All paid channels like to online TV
"Great, but noise and image not quite synchronous. Sound runs something before, so at a football match you will hear that it is a goal before you see it yourself. That is very irritating."
"It is ridiculous that Formula 1 will not be passed freely for what I have been paying for subscription costs all those years. 
 Extra WiFi points only for new clients but not yet long -existing customers. 
 Start becoming a bit irritated now. 
 For the rest, always satisfied with KPN and certainly about the service. 
 Yours sincerely , 
 Jans Hoogeveen"
"Everything works perfectly, nice image and everything is right"
"With the TV guide you can only select today or the following days and not select days ago. This is very annoying to look back. You have to constantly press the left arrow to get to the right day. Maybe I am doing something wrong, if so I would like to know how I can select days ago."
Boundary
Image and sound transfer goes with horts and bumps. Worthless.
Befankt for the service
works well
Regular interruptions
A program in the pause stand jumps off. System does not hold what you have already looked at. Especially annoying if you don't like advertisements and watch a program of the commerciles.
What one buffered ... Pfff
"Looking nice TV, loads fast, zappen could be even better on the laptop, at the smartphone I can sweep so beautiful to change channels."
We have never succeeded in looking at a full program via KPN live TV on the iMac. So frustrating ...
Can not find / install your app on no tv oid
is often fixed
"The fact that you can watch TV and recordings on the laptop is in principle fine. However, the receipt / internet is regularly poor, so that the image is frequently quiet and a red circle is displayed as if it is building a buffer"
I think this is a very nice page. He almost always works. Compliments and chapeau!
I have bad reception via ITV KPN via laptop.
The stream runs entire time on a new Mac with an M1 processor and 8GB RAM
At Safari / MacOS it is not possible to turn off the subtitles
keeps crashing.........
"Subtitles on BBC1 and BBC2 is extremely large, which means unusable"
In overview with thumbnails show what is on TV at that time and no (often outdated) title card. See Ziggo.
"Excellent quality, nothing to regard"
"As a loyal customer I think watching F1 is a bit expensive! 
 At KPN and a pity that you can't rinse back 
 Sometimes I have not watched the film, then you cannot flush the next day at where you left."
Looking up programs and especially missed programs is not that nice yet
bad connection falter very often
"Works well, just a pity that it doesn't run synchrome with the TV. Is a delay in 1 minute"
"I spell formula 1 and don't feel like an extra ziggo package. Then I can switch just as well to Ziggo. 
 Can you not make it to do that / make it off?"
"Stored films, falter often fall."
Renew a channel often gives a 'cog' that continues to run
good  
"I watch TV programs but only via the internet, on my computer, iPad etc. not via my TV. However, I have to take a TV subscription to succeed. 
 Adjust your services. I have not been looking through my TV for years."
"A number of channels (Ard, ZDF, Arte) cannot be seen via the tablet. Very sorry. Make it possible !!."
"Can zap between different television channels, that's the only thing I'm wrong. Now I have to close and back to select another channel"
Develop Desktop app
Just away well works perfectly
Why not a change of channel for the World Cup qualification
"worthless. I can't even look decently a series. The series is currently loading. I can watch Netflix, Ziggo online, video country and Disneyplus without problems, but KPN IT is worthless !!!!!!"
Don't ask me unsolicited for feedback. Disturbing request :-(
"Ivind that there has been a lot of malfunctions lately, the internet is also bad and that for almost 80 euros per mouth."
falls away and is always interrupted when you look.
"Today the message again regularly that an unexpected error has occurred. 
 On the advice from KPN switched to Google Chrome because this report regularly came up with Firefox. 
 But that has not solved the problem. 
 Had contact 3 times, sent three times with a ball in the reed."
No stabile internet image is often silent and walking around
Good image quality
Great that it is possible. Would also like to watch on vacation via the PC. We often leave with the camper at home and abroad
"The NPO1 2 and 3 channels are almost not watching! 
 The broadcasts are stick. The other channels can be viewed without disturbances."
"unstable, occasionally the player stops"
because
"Am very satisfied, all at KPN ITV on my laptop it often fails. Would not know what to do about this. I am very satisfied with KPN"
"Pause button in the middle of the picture is icon 
 And putting controls in the middle of the image is not handy (if you want to keep seeing a timeline, you are in the screen with those controls)"
Can't save quickly ... or I can't find the function
"1) All can fast forward, rewind. That advertising sometimes needs fine, but even with NLzite you can get back and forth. 
 2) Can look back directly at the end program is often impossible, you have to wait 30 minutes, that's a shame."
"Bad, often remain buffering hitches or constantly."
It could be better remembered where I (online) look at. And recordings from BBC First can simply show /
"again faltering connection, actually always in the evening 
 A turning round in the middle. 
 In the evening the download speed is often very low, 8 MB / s"
"he loads too much time, terribly annoying"
The image always runs and on my phone exactly the same in the KPN ITV online.
Hiring stream
poor connection
Fine. Works excellent.

"My images on TV are jerky, (via the laptop) 
 Internet too slow? 
 Already pay a lot, expect this will not occur."
"Looking back does not always work. 
 Broadcasts that are viewed many such as major football matches are often not even visible by buffer problems. 
 Resolution is not to write home about."
clear and clear
Watch online TV falter occasionally.
"Better like the TV itself, I really disturb that you cannot move forward with a program"
Preferably 1080p60
easy to use
Scrolling through the channels does not work. I only see the first 4 on my laptop and I can't scroll down
There is a regular hiccups in the broadcasts.
I miss Tve (Spanish channel)
no
I cannot watch a program via the app or television.xs4all.nl on 3 different devices for more than half an hour. And no malfunction known. Very annoying
"Moderate quality and regularly strange malfunction, which means I have to log in again."
"I would like to see 2 buttons: in addition to the 'Watch' button, also a button for 'watching from the beginning'. 
 I miss that in particular for live sports programs."
"If I do not switch on directly to a NPO transmitter, the image remains, however, noise will continue. This does not apply to other channels"
Nice extra good image in my office.
"Page continues to hang regularly, indicates cannot look back while you recorded it. very annoying."

"very annoying that there are so many channels, but certainly also previous recordings, not to look back online !!!!!"
stops every time
"Well-arranged, good pagine."
Easily works
Could be better
"I have to give up the pin code every time. That used to be. Very annoying. In addition, it takes a very long time before the WebApp starts."
The remark: 'Hey you' there I find very rude and I always have problems with SBS6 in particular that the sound is very bad and the image sometimes stands still.
Too bad that the scheduled recordings are no longer in order (first admission in front)
"You must have a whole good internet connection if you want to watch this well. I am apparently not that. 
 netflix watching goes very well but kpnitv not and that's crazy"
Flushing for 10 seconds or back with cursor keys for 10 seconds
Online TV is not always doing so well
Everything Top
minimal
Why can't I set memories on my laptop on TV
All kinds of channels that are not in my TV package in the list but that you can then not see such as Turkish and Indian channels
"With iPhone you have an update in the new iOS that you can watch screen-in screen. So for example, whatsappen and KPN ITV can watch at the same time. Although this does work with the KPN app, it does not go liquid and the image is often put on a break. Some annoyance. Furthermore, great!"
no opinion
The image is not full screen at full screen
"Often you can't look back, programs do not continue just like on TV so you have to go back nd TV guide and look again because rinsing is therefore often not possible"
I have been terribly irritated lately because the recordings (and also live) are interrupted every time by buffer ............... very irrigant.
Stop that `Give us feedback 'popups-if you are happy!
Continuing series of series could be easier
minimal
Claims if after a break the end of the series or program away Zip on RTL 4 already complained so much about it but nothing is done. or understood
Annoying that those things remain from time / rewind in the middle.
good  
At least I find him less good as the online page of Ziggo. Also because fewer channels are available than on my TV
"Line over screen at the bottom of the now, so that everywhere is clear"
Great that we can watch orange under 21 through you
"Now fine, however, there are moments that it is quite faltered"
"Without I want that, the app jumps which is then about 20:00 to the overview from 00:00. This happens when the mouse is just moving."
"Since the update from KPN ITV, I camp with a heavy lay on every channel that I try to watch online via the computer. This previously wasn't the case. This is only the case with KPN ITV, since I have no further problems with 'delayed' internet in any way."
can often not look back with persons often do not work
"Is a malfunction, on computer"
"Good image, but find transmitter would be a lot easier if they were to match TV (numbers)"
programs often run and on a channel where you cannot flush it is very annoying
"In the browser Edge you can only look at NPO 1 and 2 and 3, in Firefox you can watch all channels"
Before
always need to log in to my chromebook because the app does not work
"App (for a long time) no longer works on the iPad 2. Nice, well done!"
"Same as yesterday, 7 x clicks on a button before I can look at the news while also in 3x could, for example, link, log in, select channel = 3x"
"working transmitter, the page in itself does not interest me if the channel gets crashes"
Subtitles does not work
Works very badly. incomplete / lazy programming.
I find it very annoying that I cannot use my subscription outside the EU. I pay a high amount every month for my subscription and is limited to my use by this rule.
Ve meat meat ghost
"Great, satisfactory, but my wife cannot handle it. Too complicated! But I always help her and then it's going! She doesn't use it that often either."
Bad nothing can look good on the laptop or he keeps running
"The version of the app on the iPad provides problems. If I turn off the app, he no longer starts up and the iPad should completely turn off to work the app again."
"On the app: 1 Using saved button, not continuous notification that recordings can be found below that other button soon. Just use that new button and remove the old."
"Overview (guide) Excellent, recording absolutely well, but look back for time no longer works via a laptop. (Red popup with 'An unexpected error has occurred. Try later. (undefined)'"
Standard resolution set too high for my connection / PC. Always trotter. No problems with a resolution manually reduce.
Operation can be better
"TV guide always starts with changing day as early as possible, while most programs to look back on a total of other times are dots."
"Searching for TV See a different channel (via booklet icon) the entire zipper channels passes through the image, it would be a strip on the left to scroll from top to bottom instead of left to right through the image. 

 Another thing I miss is the ability to switch directly between 2 channels, now you first have to look up the transmitter again and then just click. A separate 'button' would be more convenient."
""
"Why is it so hard to launch recordings and stop at the time they start and stop? Don't start five minutes earlier and if a live program runs five minutes to early? 

 Also: the app (iOS) pauses when removing the headphones and runs ... 

 Also: the menus of the TV receiver are slow."
worthless
"I would like if you are looking for something that there are options such as a program names. 
 At series if your video country has that you also categorically, for example, drama actually just like with the films."
There are many malfunctions
"works fine,"
"Watch stored programs often get stuck when the program has been on a break for a few minutes. Then the entire page has to be refreshed, because nothing else works, and the program starts from the front, and you have to rinse again to where you had stayed"
Why can't I plan and record first date
Good and well -arranged
"I was working on feedback and now it's suddenly gone. I would also like to be able to look at a channel and then returned 30 minutes, so I don't miss the start of the program if I'm just too late. Regularly knocks the start time in the TV guide and I just miss it. If I choose the program I can go just the beginning. I also have this if a child lock program comes after a program (no longer had anymore happily) that I just missed the final of a quiz or the result. Very annoying, because the children's lock program did not show the end of the quiz. So like looking back what kind of works when you want to look back much later. Sometimes looking back does not work if you want to look back after the program. Notification Not available. Then you have to wait until you can look back."
Better
Nice clear website. Super as a second screen.
"If I want to see again online via laptop or mobile programs, I notice that image and sound just doesn't run synchronously. 

 I also wonder if the TV guide on the laptop is also vertically set."
"There are many malfunctions/hitches. Many films and programs that you can watch via Plus package do not load well. If you make something on a break and you're gone for more than 20 seconds, you have to look again (including 7 minutes of advertising. Fifteen minutes or longer if there are 2 advertising blocks in it, even if you've just seen all those advertisements and then have to you also watch the entire movie again). Many episodes do not immediately play off the series in the plus package, not even after renewing a number of times and restarting PC. You cannot look further until you have waited 1 or 2 days
But the biggest issue is that you can't do something through/back, you always have to look advertising, the app and site don't work properly, then you have to start over again, you have to do everything you have looked at and you have to do all the advertisements Also look again. It would be better if you could flush a piece (possibly rewind) to where you already looked

Last but not least, the Feeback box is very small, you always have to scroll (but that goes too fast) to see what you have written. 2 and half to 3 sentences is a bit tight. It would be nice if you could see what you wrote, so that you don't repeat things, or omit things, because you think you already said them

I have given 2 stars, that is pure and just because I have the option to look some things. For ease of use, offer and how everything works, it would otherwise be 1 star
If there were no problems with loading after you had it for 1 or 2 minutes on a break, I would immediately give 4 stars"
Better overview.
"I think it is strange that some can be watched on TV but not on a PC, see the difference. Will have to do with straight. 

 Storage capacity is too small :-) :-)"
"Good morning, I would like to see the choice at the TV guide to click on time locks, such as 20.30 You, so that you can see programs from 20.30 without having to move the bar (in the morning endless) to the right"
Does not work with Zscaler. Can view 'on TV' but if you want to start a channel I get error code 1001
It works well.
"Nice that you can watch TV via the computer. 
 Just a pity that the stream does not always continue to walk through new programs."
"The online streaming sometimes goes without a statement. This seems to happen in particular if the program has ended up in reality, but you had gone back through the timeline. For example, a piece to be reviewed. 

 It is also crazy that NPO programs can only be seen 1 day. While you can look back online at the NPO for months. That is crooked."
"Option for compact display (less scrolling) would be very welcome. 
 The advertising for programs directly under 'Start' does not have to be for me. Can at least be smaller (2 next to each other?)."
None is so good
Too bad that not all transmitters look back and press ahead
Good and well-arranged and especially user-friendly.
"Good, only recordings can look back."
If you want to look at the sex channels you have to do all you
Option 'Further look' does not work more often. I regularly look up recordings in parts and if I want to see where I stayed then the recording starts from the start. Very disturbing.
runs like a tierelier
Regularly unexpected non-working options. Now I suddenly get a message that I don't have a recording package when I click on 'saved'
"Nowadays, stuck more often after removing a saved item"
nice!
"If it gets busier on the network that you cannot start the transmitter, reconnecting the message."
It is easy to operate and when my wife looks slightly different I can watch my programs on my own TV.
"good evening,

The app is getting better and I find the interactivity great especially so continue with innovation and look forward to looking at, only the malfunctions during certain programs are not well informed from the KPN. Vb. A number of football matches were full of fixed runners and not accessible from the app. Looking at the general disruptions of that moment that were checked in general malfunctions in different channels, quite a few malfunctions that have not been communicated at the time the place took place and was often only triggered after a number of users had informed this to the service desk of KPN It seems that you don't keep an eye on this.
And then the idea not to rinse forward or backwards while looking back and is for me and many of my colleagues, friends, family, acquaintances and children the reason that we do not look back on programs at programs that we have not seen and that Gives a distorted image with your statistics because we like to look back things back.
If you want to spar over the user experience with me and my colleagues, friends, family, acquaintances and children, I would like to hear that.

Another nice evening and with kind regards,

Feroz."
If the WiFi works
"If I changed from WiFi within my house (Extender), the episode (VI Veronica) will be played again at the start, without going back to the time where I had remained. Sometimes I have to look again"
"I need to connect my laptop to the TV and use this page, because when I use the KPN ITV app on my iPhone and connect it via an Apple's official cable to the TV the image does not appear on the TV. 
 The image of the iPhone is 'gemrord' (shown) until I start a recorded program in the KPN app to play. 
 In short: showing the iPhone screen on the TV always works except if I start a recorded program to play. So it is not at the cable, the iPhone or the TV, but on the app. 
 Can you now join this now? Then I no longer have to bring my laptop. 
 Many thanks in advance."

"Since March 22, KPN TV, but today March 29 already a problem I had to turn the modem off and to"
Beautiful and well-arranged page. Apart from a single runner after removing a recording no problems. That was different in earlier versions. Now it is still waiting for an app for Android TV
Leave this telfort site in the air.
"The majority does not work. 
 If it already works, flushing often cannot flush. 
 Simply Rubbish."
I can't look back when the program has ended.
"TV guide has been a problem for years. Had took hopes that the new layout would be solved, unfortunately. You can only get from left to right 
 scroll and not from top to bottom. Very irritating."
Just flushing do not flush and few choices in the filter for channels.
"Broadcasts and recordings always stop a second except for Ned. 1. 2, and three"
Formula 1 look for less money
"Series recordings sometimes don't work, watching recordings sometimes don't work, some programs cannot be looked back."
very well

"Your TV app hasn't done well for a while. Have reported this several times, but has still not been resolved."
Why does he sometimes stutter while the connection is good.
"Functions great, I am very happy with it."
first
Beam with time in TV Guide is poorly legible by white letters (numbers) on yellow background. Furthermore very satisfied
Now we see O.A. Why we have to reward the care better.
"Sometimes no connection at once, the system will remain search. But generally fine."
"Nice page, but little cool choice films and series"
good  
An excellent service from KPN. Who needs a television?
I would like to rinse more channels back
"Many hitches. 
 Upon look back you see a portion of the broadcast"
Site takes a lot of data power (WiFi).
It is a pity that the recordings of BBC First and the Belgian channels cannot be viewed via the laptop and the mobile devices. Can you do something about it?
difficult to receive several times
"Transmitter Hapert is bad, I can look bad. I think this is with you because, for example, YouTube works well. Would you like to look at it? Thank you in advance. Best regards."
"Regular (5-10 times per evening) The notification that an unknown error has occurred and the advice to try again later. (1002) 
 And nobody gives me a solution"
Broadcast Stop Continue. keep buffering ...
"Why can I see the local channels of Amsterdam and Friesland, but not that from where I live: (on the border of) Drenthe and Groningen"
Maybe make an app for?
"Great, works properly! Make a lot of use"
great picture
"Prima, make use of every day."
I want free ziggo
"Very satisfied currently 
 Fortunately, because it has been different;)"
Very annoying that the sound will always go to the image after a while. Both in Google Chrome and in other browsers. Drivers and software are up to date and also other streaming services do not issue problems.
Very satisfied
"It is a great function, especially like that"
"1. Looking back programs is often difficult if you are just too late. Then you have to wait a long time until you can see it back. Very annoying! 
 2. If we put a program on a break and later (15 minutes later) want to look further, we often have to look the entire program again from the start. 
 At Ziggo we had no problems with this. We doubt about a switch because we only look back programs. We prefer to remain just at KPN, but it is a shame."
I only miss the app for Android TV
"Rinse forward is often disabled. Would be nice that start where you choose is always possible or that when you close the browser because you have to leave. And later that program / series / film also wants to see that you should not look for another hour. That is a waste of data, energy and time."
Top page
I think it's really worthless that a number of channel can only be viewed at home online. That is possible at Ziggo. Why not at KPN?
A button to go to Series to next and previous episode. That would be nice. With search I find with 'Marvels agents of s.h.i.e.l.d.' But 1 episode while 3 are available. At first I thought that Veronica only this series on Saturday but last week there was also an episode on Sunday.
There is an annoying short break in the broadcast
The time is currently at the age of 1900 in the guide and the right time is now at this time 2100 hours the clock seems to be behind instead of being put forward
"We have glass fibers, I gave wired the PC but log in goes so slow. And often fall away. No connection, I am only the code he loses"
It wasn't Ukie Hoekema who didn't go to Argentina from protest.
Wasn't it Oekie Hoekema who didn't go to Argentina? Out of protest
"Clear overview, I am still from the generation that a glance all programs saw at a glance on paper. Can it also be e-mail?"
"I have arranged that when looking back by a program that will jam. It is then indicated that fast rinsing is not possible, while I am not rinsing / washing forward. Often this happens in the middle of advertising. If I want to look back later, you must look back on the program."
well-arranged and therefore clear
"I find it annoying that you cannot look back many recorded programs except on your TV itself. I do not understand that. Digital looking should be digitally, including the same device to operate."
"The reception of ITV has brief every 3 seconds 
 What a program look annoying. 
 What can we do? 

 Greeting Jack Fishermen"
Why can't I see a TV guide anymore
It was getting used to but now satisfied
Why don't I get to see a guide anymore
"1. Why can't I delete that episode upon recording, episode next to play? 
 2. Why should I make loggies known, my client IP address is known? 
 3, Where is image for image (Frame by Frame), I would like to be able to view Magocheltucs / special effects? 
 4. Where is export recording, just like that possible at Ziggo?"
Top
"I regularly have a standing image I am quite angry with it went well for a long time, but the last few weeks it is worthless again"
Is Trainer V D DRIO RIPE for a contract extension
"Now when I want to see a program, first click on the program. Then I have to log in. Then I have to click a screen that reports what kind of nice service you offer. Then I have to click on the program what I want to see ..... and hehe, then I can watch ....."
Great that you can also watch your laptop on your laptop via KPN ITV!
nvt
SUPER
poor boot
Great page
Bad connection image always quiet
Has regularly trouble showing the images you will see the green round circle that it is buffering
"After selecting a program for recording, the menu shoots to 00:00 in the morning of the day."
like to zappen sender in fullscreen
That the app does not continue to load around half past six all the time
"In itself fine, what kind of counterpart I have taken over since your Telfort I have very bad WiFi throughout the house, as a gift that we went with KPN it would be nice to get WiFi amplifiers for free and we are always at 4 G With all subscriptions from all our mobile phones, kidney must be allowed and allowed"
Sometimes a channel falls out and I can't get it back.
Awesome
"Especially the guide, wanted to be able to select favorite channels (private guide say)"
"The page is way too heavy for an even good PC. 
 The automatic resolution setting chooses too high a resolution so that the image does not play smoothly. 
 I have to manually adjust the resolution for each program. This should only be possible when reconfirmed."
Would also like to be able to switch through the channels by up or down
"Lately a lot of malfunctioning standing image, among other things."
"I use the online TV via my laptop. It is not useful if your programs want to look back because you should always go back with the left arrow to see what was there. It would be much better if you could also filter per genre per day and per channel. Furthermore, I have experienced a few times that I am looking back at a movie, and then he stops, and I have to restart him again, with some channels it is not allowed to rinse ahead, so then it is just bad luck, or wait patiently to The moment you left, or just specify ... not really fine. I expect a better service from KPN! That equal is the price that I have to pay."
often bad streaming
I would like to have the opportunity to put together your own guide in your TV guide ...
It is sometimes really looking for the channel you are looking for.
"TV guide: times on yellow on yellow who makes this and then look at it again ??? 
 If you choose a program that has just not started, you will receive the choice but why not if it says within fifteen minutes of the start time is also the choice 'is already on ...' ???"
nee
"Recording often does not want, you click on it and again on the choices - when watching the TV guide (and you want to record something) he jumps up again. Sometimes it wants to record, but so in once, he throws everything out and so you miss sharing until you discover it."
everything is OK. will be easy what you are looking at in a separate folder then you can always look back when you stopped
There are regular hitch.
nice
Fair often with good WiFi
"After each software update, the online app works worse. Scheduled recordings have now been disappeared. I have a whole list of things that no longer function, or much worse than before. It is very disturbing to notice that something well worked, with a subsequent update it no longer does. That is not incidental, almost after every update is going on. Due to my experience as a release manager, I have my doubts about your test quality. 
 Regrettable!"
"If you have taken the recording package. You must actually be able to look back on the absorbed material on each device. It should not happen that you cannot look back on your tablet, for example ......."
Very messy and unclear
Good
Law Certain recordings only look through decoder Take very unpleasant use! At Ziggo this was Njetzo
"Great page. If you are increasingly imagining Ziggo online. Also a shame if I want to look back something, the relevant program halfway '' freezes ''."
It is good but if I take the laptop I can't see everything then I have to enter another code and you don't always know and that is difficult and sure if you want to watch recordings.
Very bad I can't follow channels only 1 and 2 The rest is very bad.
Very unfortunate that the live break function is often not done; As if you can't look back immediately saved programs and then the message is not to look back .... really thick doubts or I have to switch :(
"Still another set-up of the TV guide. 
 For the rest, it works particularly well."
"Make it clearer. Some things are even hard to find. And adjust the account equal to the customer's subscription, not that the customer must do it yourself"
"Nothing is perfect, but this works great."
really top
"Try to look short TV on the laptop via KPNITV i.p.v. at Telfort, you don't keep it a minute for a minute, the image continues to continue and then continues, this went well at Telfort, then again via Telfort TV again look"
"Works pretty well. But the transmitter icons are sometimes small (eg Discovery) then I look for myself. 

 It is also a shame that the German channels are not watching."
A lot of malfunction in sound and regularly that the image is stuck when looking back at once the text you cannot flush while I don't do that at all
Nice program
nice overview
"Beautiful image, but ... I want to find so much how I can set the background - with dark images - differently. Like your help!"
Clear images. Happiness that contests are also broadcast in the lower region
You cannot view all recordings via this medium
"I think the time tables in the overview are unclear, it would be nice to be able to use the old way again or to be able to choose it"
"I live / work in Italy, watch TV online V KPN evening and I am very satisfied with it. There is actually only 1 wish from my side: Why can't I look back and only follow Live to look at ID TV (and some other channels)? Furthermore thick sufficient"
"I have to log in again and again, what can be done about it?"
Whether and then the image fails and stays 'hanging' while the WiFi speed is high enough above 150. Can something be done against this?
"KPN A company that deserves billions comes from a company that is active in the Netherlands for a hundred years and then you cannot even make decent TV menus and online streaming. Your TV menu was reasonable, but since your changes it has become worse in the last 2 years. Slow and illogical, shame"
"The go back to the start of the site does not work, then JE go out completely, annoying"
fast and effective
The pause function in the app does not work optimally. Often the program then jumps to the live broadcast.
To half an hour the TV switches off on the laptop
"Generally very satisfied! 
 Only the navigation on my macbook I find messy. 
 Nice to have KNP in Spain :-)"
perfect.....
first
Online connection is far too often disappeared
"Can not see everything on the way I record. 
 I also cannot see some channels on the way 
 That is not passed on to the subscription"
"I would like to see the resolution adjustment as recorded. Now when changing transmitter, you have to use the resolution of a low-low resolution every time. This i.v.m. The available bandwidth at our holiday park"
I would like to see more regional channels in the app. I cannot find Friesland with Frisian Dialect on Dutch KPN I-TV
"It is delicious to make another fragment of it's no matter what to look back. Great to plan a recording !! 
 Read a little movies, really nice"
"Find a nice quality program quality. 
 Hope this can be so farther and perhaps also more programs"
"Why are at least three channels shown twice? Why are some German channels, such as Ard, not always available? Furthermore fine."
"Almost perfect! Only the subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing is a bit poor. Often runs behind, also where the program is not live. Nowadays, subtitles is very easy to turn out and to enable what a great improvement!"
"The play and pause button is in the middle of the screen - can't this just be in Player? 

 Also the mouse location on the screen shows the play / pause button continuously - a fade away from the control elements would be much friendlier."
first!
"Very often I cannot look back on the PC that I can look back on the TV 
 Flushing often does not work while it succeeds on the TV 
 Mainly NL 1"
"I find it easier to watch online TV, I don't have to have 2 devices (TV and PC)"
It would be nice if the European channels such as Germany can also be viewed via the app
"Before you can watch you have a lame finger of the entire login procedure, what an amateur that came up with ..."
When logging in I have to try it again 20 times again I want to be able to watch TV!
"Great, use it daily on my laptop."
streamed badly
At the moment the page is reliable but occasionally he lies out and it takes long before you can watch again
"The last journal is no longer looking back shortly after the burden-like, that is very annoying. Like to adjust again how it was low."
Hapert too much
Hitch image and sound
Why can't I see RTL De Blau Light Report on the internet I want to see on the internet
everything just perfect
"Images falter, come jerky to P.C. 
 Doesn't stream well !!!"
Very good since the previous version
"When looking back, he switches to the live TV as the program that you look back has ended according to the program guide. Irritating. In addition, stability is also not to write home about (Mac Book Pro / Safari)"
"Which ""opinion"" will you hear."
does not apply
"Woof! 
 Or what do you think of using the imperative wise where nothing is asked by the end user?"
TV on laptop Havertt a lot is also not synchronic
Very nice picture
FINE APP! You see that work is constantly working with small and large improvements.
The search function does not work properly
Super satisfied!
"Nice to use, alone he regularly attaches."
"NPO 1, 2, 3 have been shocking image for a while. 
 TV guide can be better, faster information about program. 
 Shortcuts for channel choice. 
 Dolby Digital 5.1 Sound."
"The rewind goes too often. Too often he doesn't do that, and sometimes plays the program halfway."
"None, it works super"
Lovely. Watch my own TV programs
"When I look for the TV guide on my laptop, it happens that it says and programs that last a very long time. The title is always at the very beginning. Can you let that title move with the button now?"
The videos are displayed on a supported browser with malfunction (flickering of the image). (Edge Chromium)
"Nice that it is and you can save recordings, but there are also a number of things that don't work properly. The TV guide always jumps back to the initial hour and you can often not make serial recordings, because it is getting out again."
I am very satisfied and is a must for everyone.
The page is very slow
just a pity that we can't see all channels from home
Top
"Fantastic opportunity to watch TV elsewhere .. clear view. 
 Miss the possibility to have the sound displayed via another device. But maybe I'm not doing something right."
Before
Totally awesome
"No improve points, unfortunately"
Great that this is possible
just good
"NPO channels okay, all commercial channels hacking :-("
I wish we could have the same TV channels on ITV
"Quality is fine. Occasionally awkward. With mouse / keyboard more buttons than a remote control, it goes more difficult. Zapping, for example (or more useful, changing two channels)."
Web team ftw!
